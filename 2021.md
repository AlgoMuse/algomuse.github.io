## CMI Entrance Exam 2021: Solutions


### Part-A : Multiple-choice questions

**For each question pick all the options that are true. More than one option may be true.**

<p>
<b>A1.</b> Consider the following equations:
\begin{align*}
\log_{2021} a &= 2022 -a \\
2021^b &= 2022-b
\end{align*}

(a) There is a unique \(a\) that satisfies the first equation.<br>
(b) There is a unique \(b\) that satisfies the second equation.<br>
(c) There exists a solution for both the equations such that \(a=b\).<br>
(d) There exists a solution for both the equations such that \(a+b\) is an integer.

</p>


<details><summary>Solution</summary>
(a) True. \(f(a)=\log_{2021} a + a - 2022\) is an increasing function in \(a\). So \(a=2021\) is the only solution.<br>
(b) True. \(g(b)=2021^b + b - 2022\) is an increasing function in \(b\). So \(b=1\) is the only solution.<br>
(c) False. Follows from above.<br>
(d) True. Since, \(2021+1\) is an integer.<br>
</details>




<p>
<b>A2.</b> If \(p\) is a prime number, which of the following are true?<br>

(a) For every prime \(p\), \(p^2-p\) is divisible by 3. <br>
(b) For every prime \(p>3\), exactly \(p-1\) or \(p+1\) is divisible by 6.<br>
(c) For every prime \(p>3\), \(p^2-1\) is divisible by 24.<br>
(d) For every prime \(p>3\), one of \(p+1\),\(p+3\) and \(p+5\) is divisible by 8.
</p>


<details><summary>Solution</summary>
(a) False. \(5^2-5\) is not divisible by 3.<br>
(b) True. Both 3 and 2 must be factors of either \(p-1\) or \(p+1\). Since \(p\) is an odd prime, it is not divisible by 3. So either \(p-1\) or \(p+1\) is divisible by 3. But \(p-1\) and \(p+1\) are both even.<br>
(c) True. \(p\) is either \(4k+1\) or \(4k+3\). So \(p^2-1\) has 8 and 3 as factors.<br>
(d) False. Put \(p=17\). <br>
</details>




<p>
<b>A3.</b> \(ABC\) is a triangle such that \(AB=1\) cm and \(\angle CAB = 20.21^{\circ}\). Let \(N(x)\) denote the number of non-congruent triangles
such that \(BC=x\) cm, where \(x\) is a positive real number.  There exists an \(x\) such that:<br>
(a)  \(N(x)=0\).<br>
(b)  \(N(x)=1\).<br>
(c)  \(N(x)=2\).<br>
(d)  \(N(x)=3\).<br>
</p>


<details><summary>Solution</summary>
(a) True.<br>
(b) True.<br>
(c) True.<br>
(d) False. <br>

<i>Explanation. </i> Consider the line \(l\) that passes through \(A\) at an angle \(20.21^\circ\) to \(AB\). Let the length
of the shortest distance from \(l\) to \(B\) be \(d\). If \(x< d\) there is no solution. If \(x=d\) there is
exactly one solution. If \(1>x>d\), there are two solutions.<br>

</details>



<p>
<b>A4.</b> Suppose \( f(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx +c \) with \(a,b,c\) being integers. Let \(p,q,r\) denote the roots of \(f\), possible complex.<br>

(a) If \(f(1)=2021\), then \(f(x)=(x-1)(x^2+sx+t) + 2021\) such that \(s\) and \(t\) are integers.<br>
(b) There exists \(f(x)\) with \(c=2021\) and \(p=2\).<br>
(c) There exists \(f(x)\) with \(r=1/2\).<br>
(d) \(p^2+q^2+r^2\) does not depend of \(c\).<br>

</p>


<details><summary>Solution</summary>
(a) True. Compare the coefficients. \(t-1\) and \(t-s\) must be integers.<br>
(b) False. Odd-Even argument.<br>
(c) False. Implies that \(1+2a+4b+8c=0\) which can't be the case.<br>
(d) True. \(p^2+q^2+r^2=(p+q+r)^2-2(pq+qr+rp)= a^2-2b\).
</details>



<p>
<b>A5.</b> For a complex number \(z\) let \( P(z): \{z^k: k \in \{1,2,3,\ldots\} \} \).<br>

(a) For every natural number \(n\) there exits a \(z\) such that \(P(z)=n\).<br>
(b) There exits a unique \(z\) such that \(P(z)=3\).<br>
(c) If \(|z|\neq 1\) and \(|z|\neq 0\) then \(P(z)\) is an infinite set.<br>
(d) \(P(e^i)\) has infinite elements.<br>
</p>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
(a) True. Pick \(z=e^{\frac{2\pi i}{n}}\).<br>
(b) False. Both \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) work.<br>
(c) True. If \(z=re^{i\theta}\), then every number in \(P\) has a different length.<br>
(d) True. If \(e^{ia}=e^{ib}\) for some powers \(a,b\) with \(a> b\), then \(a=2k\pi+b\) for some natural number \(k\). But this would imply that \(\pi\) is rational.<br>
</details>



<p>
<b>A6.</b> A real number \(r\) is called a stationary point if \(f^\prime(r)=0\) where \(f(x)\) is a degree \(d\) polynomial.<br>

(a) If \(d=2022\), then \(f\) has at least one stationary point.<br>
(b) If \(f\) has 2021 distinct real roots, then there are at least 2020 stationary points.<br>
(c) If \(f\) has 2021 distinct real roots, then there are at most 2020 stationary points.<br>
(d) If \(r\) is a stationary point and \(f^{\prime\prime}(r)=0\), then \( (r,f(r)) \) is neither a local minima nor a local maxima.<br>
</p>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
(a) True. \(f^\prime\) has odd degree, so there is one real root.<br>
(b) True. If \(r_1 < r_2 \ldots < r_{2021}\) are the roots, then there is a stationary point between \(r_i\) and \(r_{i+1}\).<br>
(c) False. \(f\) can have any  number of stationary points without have a single real root.<br>
(d) False. \(f(x) = x^4\) is a counterexample.<br>
</details>

<p>
<b>A7.</b> \(a,b,c\) are distinct positive constants. Consider the system of equations:

\begin{align*}
ax + by &= \sqrt{2}\\
bx + cy &= \sqrt{3}
\end{align*}

(a) There exist \(a,b,c\) such that such that the system has infinite solutions.<br>
(b) There exist \(a,b,c\) such that such that the system has exactly one solution.<br>
(c) If the system has no solution, it means that \(2b < a+c\).<br>
(d) If \(2b< a+c\), then the system has no solution.<br>
</p>


<details><summary>Solution</summary>
(a) True. Pick \(a=2/3,b=\sqrt{2/3}\) and \(c=1\). Both the equations become equal.<br>
(b) True. Pick \(a=2,b=1\) and \(c=1\).<br>
(c) True. There is no solution if \(b^2-ac=0\) and \(b/c\neq \sqrt{2/3}\). The first condition implies that \(2b\leq a+c\).<br>
(d) False. Pick values given in (b).<br>
</details>




<p><b>A8.</b> Let \(\vec{v}_n\) denote a vector for \(n\in \mathbb{N}\). We define \(\vec{v}_{n+2} = \vec{v}_{n}\times \vec{v}_{n+1}\), where \(\times\) denotes the cross-product. Let \(\mathbb{0}\) denote
the zero vector. \(\vec{v}_{n}\) maybe the zero vector too. Define sets \(S\) and \(T\) as follows:

\[ S = \{ v_n : n\in \mathbb{N} \} \]
\[ U = \{ \frac{\vec{v}_n}{|\vec{v}_n|} : n \in \mathbb{N} \text{ and } \vec{v}_n \neq \mathbb{0} \} \]

(a) There exists \(\vec{v}_1\) and \( \vec{v}_2 \) such that \( |S| =2 \).<br>
(b) There exists \(\vec{v}_1\) and \( \vec{v}_2 \) such that \( |S| =3 \).<br>
(c) There exists \(\vec{v}_1\) and \( \vec{v}_2 \) such that \( |S| =4 \).<br>
(d) If  \(\vec{v}_1\) and \( \vec{v}_2 \) exist such that \( |S| = \infty \), then \(|U|=\infty\).<br>
</p>


<details><summary>Solution</summary>
(a) True. Pick \(\mathbb{1}\) and \(\mathbb{0}\). False, if \(v_1\) and \(v_2\) are non-zero.<br>
(b) True. Pick \(\vec{v_1} = \vec{i}\) and \(\vec{v_2}=\vec{j}\).<br>
(c) True. Pick \( \vec{v_1} = i+k \) and \( \vec{v_2} = i\). <br>
(d) False. Pick \(\vec{v_1} = 2\vec{i}\) and \(\vec{v_2}=3\vec{j}\). \(|S|=\infty\) but \(|U|=3\).<br>
</details>




<p><b>A9.</b> Let \(f\) and \(g\) be function defined as follows:<br>

\[ f(x) = \frac{x}{x+\sin x} \]

\[ g(x) = \frac{x^4+x^6}{e^x-1-x^2} \]

(a) \(\lim_{x\rightarrow 0} f(x) = 1/2\)<br>
(b) \(\lim_{x\rightarrow \infty} f(x)\) does not exist.<br>
(c) \(\lim_{x\rightarrow \infty} g(x) \) is finite.<br>
(d) \(\lim_{x\rightarrow 0} g(x) = 720 \).<br>

</p>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
(a) True. \(\sin x \approx x\) as \(x\rightarrow 0\).<br>
(b) False. The limit is 1.<br>
(c) True. Numerator is polynomial, while the denominator is exponential.<br>
(d) False. The limit is zero. (L'Hosptial's rule is not applicable).
</details>



<p><b>A10.</b> Let \(f(x) = \arctan(x) \) and \(g(v) = \int_0^{v} f(x) dx \).<br>


(a) \(f(1)=\pi/4\)<br>
(b) \(f(1)+f(2)+f(3)=\pi\) <br>
(c) \(g(v)\) is an increasing function in \( \mathbb{R} \).<br>
(d) \(g(v)\) is an odd function.<br>
</p>


<details><summary>Solution</summary>

<p>
(a) True.<br>
(b) True. See below. <br>
(c) False. \(g(-v) = - \int_{-v}^0 f(x) dx = g(v)\). So \(g\) is convex.<br>
(d) False. \(g\) is an even function.<br>

<i>Explanation for (b)</i>. Let \( \arctan(1)=x ; \arctan (2)=y ;\) and \(\arctan (3)=z\).<br>

\[\tan (x+y)=\frac{\tan x+\tan y}{1-\tan x \cdot \tan y}=\frac{1+2}{1-2}=-3\]

Put \(u = x+y\) and evaluate:
\[\tan (z+u)=\frac{\tan z+\tan u}{1-\tan z \cdot \tan u}=\frac{-3+3}{1-9}=0\]

So \( \tan( x+y+z ) = 0\).  Hence, \(\arctan (1)+\arctan (2)+\arctan (3)=x+y+z=\pi\).

### Part B: Subjective questions


---

<p>
<b>B1. (a)</b> \(f\) is a function defined on the domain \(S\) and codomain \(T\) and \(g\) is a function defined on the domain \(T\) and codomain \(U\).
Fill in the blanks with with one of the four options.<br>

If \(g\circ f\) is one-one then, \(f\) is \(\underline{.......}\)  and \(g\) is \(\underline{......}\).<br>
If \(g\circ f\) is onto then, \(f\) is \(\underline{.......}\)  and \(g\) is \(\underline{......}\).<br>

<br>
Options:<br>

A: One-one and onto.<br>
B: One-one but need not to be onto.<br>
C: Onto but need not to be one-one.<br>
D: Need not to be one-one and need not be onto.<br>


<br>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>

<b>Ans.</b> B-D-D-C.<br>

<i>Explanation. </i> If \(g\circ f\) is one-one, the \(f\) must be one-one. If not, there are two
elements \(x\) and \(y\) with \(x\neq y\) such that \( f(x) = f(y) \), which implies that \(g(x) = g(y)\). A contradiction.
However, \(f\) need not be onto and \(g\) need not be onto or one-one as the example below shows.

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="/assets/images/cmi2021_b1a.png"/>
</p>

<br>

If \(g\circ f\) is onto, then \(g\) must be onto since every element in \(U\) must be reached by some element from \(S\) via \(T\). As
the example below shows, this the only constraint.

<b>B1. (b)</b> \(ABCD\) is a square. Point \(X\) lies on a circle with \(AY\) as the diameter. Points \(X\) and \(Y\) lie on the sides of the
square such that \(AX=4\) cm and \(AY=5\) cm. What is the area of the square \(ABCD\)?<br>

</p>

</p>


<details><summary>Solution I via cyclic quadrilateral</summary>

<br><i>Sol. due to Abhishek Goel.</i><br><br>

Since \( \angle AXY + \angle ABY = 180^{\circ} \), \(AXYB\) is a cyclic quadrilateral.
Suppose the chord \(XY\) subtends an angle \(\theta\) at \(A\) and \(B\) as shown:

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="/assets/images/cmi2021_b1_sol.png"/>
</p>


Let the side-length of the square be \(x\).

\begin{align*}
\text{From triangle } AXY \text{ we have} \tan \theta &= \frac{3}{4} \\
\text{From triangle } XCB \text{ we have} \tan \theta &= \frac{XC}{CB} \\
\therefore XC &= \frac{3}{4}x \\
DX &= x-XC = \frac{1}{4}x\\
AD^2+DX^2 &= AX^2\\
x^2+\left(\frac{x}{4}\right)^2 &= 4^2\\
x &= \frac{16}{\sqrt{17}}\\
\text{Area of the square} &= \frac{256}{17}
\end{align*}
</details>

<p></p>

<details><summary>Solution II via similar triangles</summary>
\begin{align*}
\angle DAX &= \angle CXY\\
\implies \Delta DAX &\sim \Delta CXY \\
\frac{XY}{AX} &= \frac{XC}{AD} \\
\frac{3}{4} &= \frac{XC}{AD} \\
XC &= \frac{3}{4} AD \\
DX &= CD-CX = \frac{1}{4}AD\\
AD^2+DX^2 &= 4^2\\
AD^2+\frac{AD^2}{16} &= 16\\
AD &= \frac{16}{\sqrt{17}}\\
\text{Area of the square} &= \frac{256}{17}
\end{align*}

<p>
<b>B2 (a).</b> A mother and two daughters have a fair coin and play a game as follows. First, the mother tosses the coin.<br>

<i>Case I:</i> If the coin lands heads, then both the daughters win.<br>
<i>Case II:</i> If the coin lands tails, then each daughter rolls a fair die independently. The first daughter wins if her die comes up 5 or 6. The second
daughter wins if her die comes up 5 or 6. <br>

A game is played.<br>

<ol>
<li> What is the probability that the second daughter has lost given that the first daughter has lost?</li>
<li> What is the probability that the second daughter won given that the first daugher has won?</li>
</ol>

</p>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>

<ol>
<li>Since the outcome of the toss was tails, the second daugther lost since the die came up 1,2,3 or 4. Hence, required probability is 2/3.</li>

<li>
Let \(A\) the event that the second daughter won and \(B\) be the event that the first daughter won.<br>

\[ P(A \mid B)=\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \]


\begin{align*}
P(A \cap B)&=P(A \cap B \mid H) P(H)+P(A \cap B \mid T) P(T) \\
&=1\cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{9}\cdot \frac{1}{2} \\
&=\frac{5}{9}
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
P(B)&=P(B \mid H) P(H)+P(B \mid T) P(T) \\
&=1\cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3}\cdot \frac{1}{2} \\
&=\frac{2}{3}
\end{align*}

\[ P(A \mid B)=\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{5/9}{2/3} = \frac{5}{6} \]

</li>
</ol>

</details>



<p>
<b>B2 (b)</b> Prove or disprove:<br>
(i) \( 2^{40} > 20! \)<br>
(ii) \( 1-1/x \leq \ln x \leq x-1 \) for all \(x>0\)<br>
</p>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>

(i) False.<br>

\begin{align*}
20! &> 2\times3\times4\times5\times6\times 7\times 8\times8\times 8\ldots (\text{13 times}) \\
20! &> 2\times3\times4\times5\times6\times 7\times (2^{3})^{13} \\
20! &> 2^{40}
\end{align*}

<br><i>Comment:</i> A similar problem was asked in <a href="/docs/mock_test/006_apr_1_full/#part-b-subjective-questions">mock test #6</a> (Problem B2).<br><br>


(ii) True.<br>

Let us prove the left hand side inequality.

\begin{align*}
f(x) &:= \ln x - 1 + 1/x\\
f^\prime(x) &= 1/x(1 - 1/x)\\
\end{align*}

\(f^\prime < 0 \)  for \(x\in(0,1)\) and \(>0\) for \(x\in(1,\infty)\). This means
\(f\) is decreasing in the interval \( (0,1)\) and increasing in the interval \( (1,\infty) \). It reaches the minimum at \(x=1\) which is zero.
Hence \(f(x)\geq 0\) for all \(x > 0\).<br>


The right hand side inequality can be proved similarly.

\begin{align*}
g(x) &:= x - 1 - \ln x\\
g^\prime(x) &= 1 - 1/x
\end{align*}

Again, \( g(x) \) attains its minima of zero at \(x=1\).

<b>B5.</b> Function \(f(x)\) is defined as \(f(0)=0\) and for \(x> 0\) as

We split the function into three parts:

\(A\) is the interval before the first time the function touches zero. \(B\) is the part  of the
function that is positive for \(x>\pi/2\) and \(C\) is the part of the function that is negative. We show that
each of these intergrals converge.


<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="/assets/images/cmi_2021_damp.png"/>
</p>

\begin{align*}
A:&\int_{1/x}^{\pi/2} \frac{\cos t}{t^2} dt\\
B:& \sum_{k=0}^{n} \int_{(2k+1)\pi/2}^{(2k+3)\pi/2} \frac{\cos t}{t^2} dt\\
C:& \sum_{k=0}^{n} \int_{(2k+3)\pi/2}^{(2k+5)\pi/2} \frac{\cos t}{t^2} dt\\
\end{align*}

\(A\) is a proper integral and hence well-defined for a given \(x\). \(B\) and \(C\) are dominated by
the integrals \( \int_{\pi/2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{t^2}\) and \( -\int_{\pi/2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{t^2} dt \),
respectively and hence they converge.
</li>

<li>

The general form of Leibniz rule is:<br>

\[\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} x} \int_{a(x)}^{b(x)} f(x, t) \mathrm{d} t=f(x, b(x)) \cdot b^{\prime}(x)-f(x, a(x)) \cdot a^{\prime}(x)+\int_{a(x)}^{b(x)} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} f(x, t) \mathrm{d} t\]

Substituting, \( a(x) = 1/x \) and \(b(x)=L\), we get:<br>

\begin{align*}
f^\prime(x) &= 0- \frac{\cos(1/x)}{1/x^2}\cdot (-1/x^2) \\
f^\prime(1/\pi) &= \cos\pi = -1 \\
\end{align*}

<li>
<i>Solution due to Soham Ghosh (West Bengal).</i><br>

\begin{align*}
f(x) &=\int_{1 / x}^{\infty} \frac{1}{t^{2}} \cos t \,dt \\
&=\left.\frac{1}{t^{2}} \sin t\right|_{1 / x} ^{\infty}-\int_{1 / x}^{\infty} \frac{(-2)}{t^{3}} \sin t\, dt \;\;\text{ (using integration by parts)} \\
&=-x^{2} \sin \frac{1}{x}+\int_{1 / x}^{\infty} \frac{2}{t^{3}} \sin t\, dt \\
\end{align*}

We are required to calculate only the right-hand side limit. L'Hospital's rule is not applicable.

\[ \lim_{h \rightarrow 0^{+}} \frac{f(h)-f(0)}{h}=\lim_{h \rightarrow 0^{+}} \frac{f(h)}{h} \]


\begin{align*}
f(h)&=-h^{2} \sin \frac{1}{h}+\int_{1 / h}^{\infty} \frac{2}{t^{3}} \sin t\, d t \\
\frac{f(h)}{h}&=-h \sin \frac{1}{h}+\frac{1}{h}\int_{1 / h}^{\infty} \frac{2}{t^{3}} \sin t\, d t
\end{align*}

We will show that the limit of each summand in the LHS goes to zero.<br>


Firstly, \( \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} -h \sin \frac{1}{h} = 0 \).<br>


\begin{align*}
-\frac{2}{t^{3}} & \leq \frac{2}{t^{3}} \sin t \leq \frac{2}{t^{3}} \quad (\because-1 \leqslant \sin t \leqslant 1) \\
-\int_{1 / x}^{\infty} \frac{2}{t^{3}} d t &\leq \int_{1 / x}^{\infty} \frac{2}{t^{3}} \sin t\, dt \leq   \int_{1 / x}^{\infty} \frac{2}{t^{3}} d t \\

<b>B6.</b>  You and your friend are playing a game where there are 2 stacks of cards:<br>

Stack A has \(n\) cards and each card has a number from the set \( \{1,2,...,m\} \).<br>
Stack B has \(m\) cards and each card has a number from the set \( \{1,2,...,n\} \).<br>

You start with \(t_0=0\) and note down the following sequence \(t_1,t_2,t_3,\ldots\). The game proceeds in steps as follows:<br>

If \(t_j \leq 0\), pick out the topmost card from stack A and set \[t_{j+1}=t_j + \text{number on the topmost card drawn from Stack A}\]

If \(t_j> 0\), pick out the topmost card from stack B and set \[t_{j+1}=t_j - \text{number on the topmost card drawn from stack B}\]

The game ends when a player has to draw a card from an empty stack. <br>

Prove that<br>
<ol>
<li> \(1-n \leq t_j \leq m \) for all \(j\)</li>
<li>There exists distinct indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(t_i=t_j\)</li>
<li>Prove that there exists a non empty subset in stack A and another in B such that the sum of the numbers on those cards are equal.</li>
</ol>
</p>


<details><summary>Solution</summary>
<ol>
<li>If \(t_j\leq 0\), a card from A is removed. The maximum value of a card in A is
\(m\) so \(t_j\) can at most be \(m\). Similarly, a card from B is subtracted
when the value of \(t_j \geq 1\). Hence, the smallest value it can take is \(1-n\).</li>

<li> From (1) we see that the \(t\)-sequence can take at most \(n\) distinct
non-positive values and at most \(m\) distinct positive values.  We consider two ways in which the game can end:<br><br>

<i>Case 1: Cards in stack B are empty.</i><br>
Suppose the game ended after using up \(m\) cards from B and \(p\leq n\) cards from A.
Since the game has ended the value of \(t_{m+p}\) must be positive.  In addition, the value of \(t\) before
every card in B was added must have been positive (by the game's rule).
So the sequence \(t_1,t_2,t_3,\ldots,t_{m+p}\) contains \(m+1\) positive numbers. But since the sequence
contains \(m\) distinct positive numbers, two \(t\)s must have the same value by pigeon-hole principle.

<br><br>
<i>Case 2:  Cards in stack A are empty. </i><br>
We use a similar argument. Suppose the game ended after using up \(n\) cards from A and \(p\leq n\) cards from B.
Since the game has ended the value of \(t_{n+p}\) must be non-positive.
In addition, the value of \(t\) before every card in A was added must have been non-positive.
So the sequence \(t_0,t_1,t_2,t_3,\ldots,t_{m+p}\) contains \(n+1\) non-positive numbers.
But since the sequence contains \(n\) distinct non-positive numbers, two \(t\)s must have the same value by pigeon-hole principle.

</li>
<li>From (2), some \(t_i=t_j\). The sequence of cards added between \(t_i\) and \(t_j\) sums to zero. So some proper subset
of \(A\) and \(B\) have equal sums.</li>
</ol>
