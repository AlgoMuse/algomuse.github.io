    <solution>
Denote three roots as \(r_1 < r_2 < r_3\). Following from Vieta's formula, \(r_1 r_2 r_3=-6\).
Case 1: All roots are negative.
We have the following solution: \((-3,-2,-1)\).
Case 2: One root is negative and two roots are positive.
We have the following solutions: \((-3,1,2),(-2,1,3),(-1,2,3),(-1,1,6)\).
Putting all cases together, the total number of solutions is (A) 5 .

    <solution>
The expressions to the power of even powers are always positive, so we don't need to care about those. We only need to care about \((x-1)^1(x-3)^3(x-5)^5(x-7)^7(x-9)^9\). We need 0,2 , or 4 of the expressions to be negative. The 9 through 10 interval and 10 plus interval make all of the expressions positive. The 5 through 6 and 6 through 7 intervals make two of the expressions negative. The 1 through 2 and 2 through 3 intervals make four of the expressions negative. There are (C) 6 intervals.

    <solution>
Substituting \(a=b\) we get
\begin{align*}
f(2 a)+f(0)=2 f(a)^2
\end{align*}

Substituting \(a=0\) we find
\begin{align*}
2 f(0)=2 f(0)^2 \Longrightarrow f(0) \in\{0,1\} \text {. }
\end{align*}

This gives
\begin{align*}
f(2 a)=2 f(a)^2-f(0) \geq 0-1
\end{align*}

Plugging in \(a=\frac{1}{2}\) implies \(f(1) \geq-1\), so answer choice (E) -2 is impossible.

            The horizontal line \(y=c\) intersects the curve \(y=2 x-3 x^3\) in the first quadrant as in the figure.
            Find \(c\) so that the areas of the two shaded regions are equal. The first region being the area enclosed
            by \(x=0,y=c\) and the arc \(OA\). The second region being the portion about the line segment \(AB\).
        </text>
        <image>mt4_23_parabola.png</image>
    </questionContent>

    <solution>

        Suppose \(A(a, c)\) and \(B(b, c)\) are the points on the curve as shown in the figure.
        Therefore they satisfy \(c=2 a-3 a^{3}=2 b-3 b^{3}\).

The areas of the two shaded regions are equal if

\[c a-\int_{0}^{a}\left(2 x-3 x^{3}\right) d x=\int_{a}^{b}\left(2 x-3 x^{3}\right) d x-c(b-a) \]

Therefore \(c a-\left[x^{2}-3 \frac{x^{4}}{4}\right]_{0}^{a}=\left[x^{2}-3 \frac{x^{4}}{4}\right]_{a}^{b}-c b+c a\)
Therefore \(c a-a^{2}+3 \frac{a^{4}}{4}=b^{2}-3 \frac{b^{4}}{4}-a^{2}+3 \frac{a^{4}}{4}-c b+c a\).
Therefore \(b^{2}-3 \frac{b^{4}}{4}-b c=0\).
Substituting the value of \(c\) we get, \(b^{2}-3 \frac{b^{4}}{4}-b\left(2 b-3 b^{3}\right)=0\).

Therefore \(b^{2}-3 \frac{b^{4}}{4}-2 b^{2}+3 b^{4}=0\).

Therefore \(\frac{9}{4} b^{4}=b^{2}\).

Hence cancelling \(b^{2}\) from both sides we get, \(b^{2}=\frac{4}{9}\).

Therefore \(b=\frac{2}{3}\).

Substituting the value of \(b\) in the expression \(c=2 b-3 b^{3}\) we get, \(c=\frac{4}{9}\).

            Let \(0 < c < 1/4\) be a constant. Find a description, with proof, of the set of all continuous
            functions \(f\) : \(R \rightarrow R\) such that \(f(x)=f\left(x^2+c\right)\) for all \(x \in R\).
            Note that \(R\) denotes the set of real numbers. 
        </text>
    </questionContent>

    <solution>
We first consider the case \(c \leq 1/4\); we shall show in this case
\(f\) must be constant. The relation
\[
f(x) = f(x^2 + c) = f((-x)^2 + c) = f(-x)
\]
proves that \(f\) is an even function. Let \(r_1 \leq r_2\) be the roots of
\(x^2 + c - x\), both of which are real. If \(x > r_{2}\), define \(x_{0} =
x\) and \(x_{n+1} = \sqrt{x_{n} - c}\) for each positive integer \(x\). By
induction on \(n\), \(r_{2} < x_{n+1} < x_{n}\) for all \(n\), so the
sequence \(\{x_{n}\}\) tends to a limit \(L\) which is a root of \(x^{2} +
c = x\) not less than \(r_{2}\). Of course this means \(L = r_{2}\).
Since \(f(x) = f(x_{n})\) for all \(n\) and \(x_{n} \to r_{2}\), we
conclude \(f(x) = f(r_{2})\), so \(f\) is constant on \(x \geq r_{2}\).

If \(r_{1} < x < r_{2}\) and \(x_{n}\) is defined as before, then by
induction, \(x_{n} < x_{n+1} < r_{2}\). Note that the
sequence can be defined because \(r_{1} > c\); the latter follows by
noting that the polynomial \(x^{2} - x + c\) is positive at \(x = c\) and
has its minimum at \(1/2 > c\), so both roots are greater than \(c\). In
any case, we deduce that \(f(x)\) is also constant on \(r_{1} \leq x \leq
r_{2}\).

Finally, suppose \(x < r_{1}\). Now define \(x_{0} = x, x_{n+1} =
x_{n}^{2} + c\). Given that \(x_{n} < r_{1}\), we have \(x_{n+1} >
x_{n}\). Thus if we had \(x_{n} < r_{1}\) for all \(n\), by the same argument as
in the first case we deduce \(x_{n} \to r_{1}\) and so \(f(x) =
f(r_{1})\). Actually, this doesn't happen; eventually we have \(x_{n} >
r_{1}\), in which case \(f(x) = f(x_{n}) = f(r_{1})\) by what we have
        already shown. We conclude that \(f\) is a constant function.

Let \(O_1\) and \(O_2\) be the centers of \(C_1\) and \(C_2\), respectively. 
We are assuming \(C_1\) has radius 1 and \(C_2\) has radius
3. 
        For a fixed point \(Q\) on \(C_2\), the locus of the midpoints of the segments \(P Q\) for \(P\) lying on \(C_1\) is the image of \(C_1\) under a homothety centered at \(Q\) of radius \(1 / 2\), which is a circle of radius \(1 / 2\).
        As \(Q\) varies, the center of this smaller circle traces out a circle \(C_3\) of radius \(3 / 2\) 
        (again by homothety).
        By considering the two positions of \(Q\) on the line of centers of the circles, one sees that \(C_3\) is centered at the midpoint of \(\mathrm{O}_1 \mathrm{O}_2\), and the locus is now clearly the specified annulus.

    <solution>
Define the sequence \(x_1 = 2\), \(x_n = 2^{x_{n-1}}\) for \(n > 1\). It
suffices to show that for every \(n\), \(x_m \equiv x_{m+1} \equiv \cdots
\pmod n\) for some \(m < n\). We do this by induction on \(n\), with \(n=2\)
being obvious.

Write \(n = 2^a b\), where \(b\) is odd. It suffices to show that \(x_m
\equiv \cdots\) modulo \(2^a\) and modulo \(b\), for some \(m < n\). For the
former, we only need \(x_{n-1} \geq a\), but clearly
\(x_{n-1} \geq n\) by induction on \(n\). For the latter, note that
\(x_m \equiv x_{m+1} \equiv \cdots
\pmod b\) as long as \(x_{m-1} \equiv x_m \equiv \cdots \pmod{\phi(b)}\),
where \(\phi(n)\) is the Euler totient function. By hypothesis, this
 occurs for some \(m < \phi(b) + 1 \leq n\).
