(iii) and (iv)  All 10 roots of \(p(x)\) are real and negative. There is a root of \(p^{\prime}(x)\) between consecutive roots of \(p(x)\) (this is valid even in case of multiple roots). So all 9 roots of \(p^{\prime}(x)\) are real and negative as well. For negativity, one can also note that all coefficients of \(p^{\prime}(x)\) are positive and apply the logic in (ii) to \(p^{\prime}(x)\).

(a) Show that there are exactly 2 numbers \(a\) in \(\{2,3, \ldots, 9999\}\) for which \(a^{2}-a\) is divisible by \(10000 .\) Find these values of \(a\).
</p>

<p>
(b) Let \(n\) be a positive integer. For how many numbers \(a\) in \(\left\{2,3, \ldots, n^{2}-1\right\}\) is \(a^{2}-a\) divisible by \(n^{2} ?\) State your answer suitably in terms of \(n\) and justify.
</p>

Sol.

<p>
(a) We have \(10000=16 \times 625\) as product of prime powers. Recall the notation \(a \mid b,\) meaning \(b\) is divisible by a. We have \(10000 \mid a^{2}-a\) if and only if \((625 \mid a(a-1)\) and \(16 \mid a(a-1)) .\) Because \(a\) and \(a-1\) cannot share a factor, in turn this is equivalent to having both the conditions \((1) 625 \mid a\) or \(625 \mid a-1\) AND
(2) \(16 \mid a\) or \(16 \mid a-1 .\) Now if the coprime integers 16 and 625 both divide the same natural number (in our case \(a\) or \(a-1),\) their product 10000 will also divide this number. In our case this would force \(a=0,1,\) or \(\geq 10000,\) all of which are not allowed. Thus the given requirement on \(a\) is equivalent to having either (1) \(16 \mid a\) and \(625 \mid a-1\) OR
(2) \(16 \mid a-1\) and \(625 \mid\) a. Each case has a unique solution, respectively \(a=9376\) and \(a=625\) (e.g. use modular arithmetic:
in case \(1,\) we have \(a=625 k+1,\) which is \(k+1\) mod \(16,\) forcing \(k=15\) because \(16 \mid a\) and \(a \in\{2,3, \ldots, 9999\})\)
</p>

<p>
(b) Let \(n=p_{1}{ }^{e_{1}} \ldots p_{k}{ }^{e_{k}}\) be the factorization of \(n\) into powers of distinct primes. The analysis in part (a) tells that required values of \(a\) are obtained as follows: write \(n^{2}=x y\) as a product of two coprime integers and find values of \(a\) in \(\left\{2,3, \ldots, n^{2}-1\right\}\) that are simultaneously 0 mod \(x\) and 1 mod \(y\). These are precisely the values of \(a\) that we want. This is because each \(p_{i}^{2 e_{i}}\) must divide \(a\) or \(a-1,\) as \(a\) and \(a-1\) are coprime.


Now the Chinese remainder theorem tells you that there is always an \(a\) that is 0 mod \(x\) and 1 mod \(y\). Moreover it is unique modulo \(x y=n^{2}\) because difference between any two solutions would be divisible by \(x y\).

The total number of ways to write \(n^{2}=x y\) as a product of coprime integers is exactly \(2^{k}\) as it amounts to choosing which of the \(k\) distinct primes to include in \(x\) and then the rest go into \(y\). (Notice that \(x\) and \(y\) are not interchangeable.) However, we have to delete the two cases \(x=1, y=n^{2}\) and \(y=1, x=n^{2},\) as these will respectively lead to solutions \(a=1\) and \(a=0\) or \(n^{2},\) which are not in \(\left\{2,3, \ldots, n^{2}-1\right\} .\) Finally it is easy to see that different choices of \(x\) lead to different values of \(a\). This is because, of the primes \(p_{1}, \ldots, p_{k}\) in the factorization of \(n,\) precisely the ones dividing \(x\) will divide \(a\) and the remaining primes will not, because they divide \(a-1\).

Thus the final answer is \(2^{k}-2 .\) Note that this matches with the special case in part (a). Finally, note that there was nothing special about taking a square: instead of \(n^{2}\) it could be any positive integer \(m\) and we would proceed the same way to find requisite integers \(a\) in \(\{2,3 \ldots, m-1\}\) based on prime factorization of \(m\)

<p>For an arbitrary integer \(n,\) let \(g(n)\) be the \(G C D\) of \(2 n+9\) and \(6 n^{2}+11 n-2 .\) What is the largest positive integer that can be obtained as the value of \(g(n) ?\) If \(g(n)\) can be arbitrarily large, state so explicitly and prove it.

Sol.
<p>
Long division gives \(6 n^{2}+11 n-2=(2 n+9)(3 n-8)+70 .\) By Euclidean algorithm, \(G C D\left(6 n^{2}+11 n-2,2 n+9\right)=G C D(2 n+9,70) .\) Thus \(g(n)\) divides \(70 .\) But since \(g(n)\) divides \(2 n+9,\) which is odd, \(g(n)\) divides \(35 .\) When \(n=13,2 n+9=35\) and hence \(g(13)=35 .\) Thus the maximum value of \(g(n)\) is \(35 .\)

</p>

Sol.

<p>
Per-capita GDP is \(\frac{\text { GDP }}{\text { population }}\). Letting \(G\) and \(P\) denote the old GDP and population respectively, the new per-capita GDP is \(\frac{1.078 G}{(1+x) P}\) where \(x\) is the unknown percent change in population we wish to calculate. The percent increase in per-capita GDP is \(10 \%=0.1\) So we have \(\frac{1.078}{1+x}=1.1 .\) Solving for \(x\) we get \(1+x=\frac{1.078}{1.1}=\frac{98 \times 11}{100 \times 11}=0.98 .\) So \(x\) is -0.02 So population decreased by \(2 \%\)

<p>Find a polynomial \(p(x)\) that simultaneously has both the following properties.
(i) When \(p(x)\) is divided by \(x^{100}\) the remainder is the constant polynomial 1.<br>
(ii) When \(p(x)\) is divided by \((x-2)^{3}\) the remainder is the constant polynomial 2.<br>
</p>


Sol.

<p>
Suppose a polynomial \(f(x)\) leaves a constant remainder \(r\) when divided by the polynomial \((x-c)^{k}\).
Then \(f^{\prime}(x)\) is divisible by \((x-c)^{k-1}\).
The converse is also true: suppose for a polynomial \(f(x),\) the derivative \(f^{\prime}(x)\) is divisible by \((x-c)^{k-1},\) say \(f^{\prime}(x)=q(x)(x-c)^{k-1}\).
Then \(f(x)\) leaves a constant remainder when divided by \((x-c)^{k}\). One can see this, for example, by substituting \(u=(x-c)\) in \(q(x)(x-c)^{k-1}\) and integrating.
</p>

<p>
In the given problem \(p^{\prime}(x)\) must be divisible by \(x^{99}\) as well as by \((x-2)^{2} .\) Moreover any polynomial whose derivative is divisible by \(x^{99}(x-2)^{2}\) will leave constant remainders when divided by either of \(x^{100}\) and \((x-2)^{3}\). The simplest way to find one such \(p(x)\) is to integrate \(A x^{99}(x-2)^{2}=A\left(x^{101}-4 x^{100}+4 x^{99}\right)\) to get
</p>

\[ p(x)=A\left(\frac{x^{102}}{102}-\frac{4 x^{101}}{101}+\frac{4 x^{100}}{100}\right)+B \]

<p>
and solve for constants \(A\) and \(B\) to ensure desired values of the constant remainders. We have \(p(0)=B=1\) and \(p(2)=A\left(\frac{2^{102}}{102}-\frac{4 \times 2^{101}}{101}+\frac{4 \times 2^{100}}{100}\right)+1=2,\) which gives \(A\)

(ii) Theoretical approach. Working through the following reasoning will be very useful for your understanding of basic arithmetic/algebra.
It explains how to implememt the Chinese remainder theorem using the Euclidean algorithm for finding GCD. This theorem states the following. One can always find an integer that leaves desired remainders when divided by two coprime integers a and b.
Suppose we are required to find an integer that leaves remainder \(r\) when divided by a and remainder \(s\) when divided by \(b\). A way to achieve this systematically is to use the Euclidean algorithm, which finds GCD of two numbers by repeated division with remainder. This algorithm also enables one to write the GCD in the form \(x a+y b,\) where the integers \(x, y\) can be found explicitly by backward substitution in the steps used to calculate the GCD. If \(a\) and \(b\) are coprime, i.e. if their GCD is \(1,\) then we can write \(1=x a+y b . \quad\) This tells you that \(x a\) is 1 modulo \(b\) and \(y b\) is 1 modulo a. Therefore,
s.xa \(+r y b\) is \(r\) modulo \(a\) and \(s\) modulo \(b\)
The relevance for this problem is that the same reasoning applies for polynomials in one variable, because in this setting too one has division with remainder. Because \(x^{100}\) and \((x-2)^{3}\) do not share a common factor, you know without any work that a polynomial with given properties must exist. The same algorithm as the previous paragraph (but now with polynomials) gives a systematic way to find it. In the given problem we could use a different trick because the specified remainders here were rather simple (constants). But there is a conceptual way as well by implementing the Chinese remainder theorem.

(a) no solutions for some but not all \(\vec{p}\); exactly one solution for all other \(\vec{p} ?\)
(b) exactly one solution for some but not all \(\vec{p} ;\) more than one solution for all other \(\vec{p} ?\)

(d) no solutions for some \(\vec{p},\) exactly one solution for some \(\vec{p}\) and more than one solution for some \(\vec{p} ?\)
</p>


Sol.


<p>If \(M\) has nonzero determinant, then for any \(\vec{p},\) we see that \(M \vec{x}=\vec{p}\) has the unique solution \(\vec{x}=M^{-1} \vec{p} .\) If determinant of \(M\) is zero then we can make two cases. (i) If \(M\) is the zero matrix, then \(M \vec{x}=\vec{p}\) has infinitely many solutions for \(\vec{p}=\overrightarrow{0}\) and no solutions otherwise. (ii) If \(M\) is nonzero then it is easy to see that we are solving two equations in two variables whose left hand sides are proportional. So if the two right hand constants that make up \(\vec{p}\) are in the same proportion, then we will have infinitely many solutions (because one of the variables can be arbitrary). If the constants are not in the same proportion, then the two equations will be inconsistent and we will have no solutions. Thus the answer is NNYN. It is also possible to think geometrically in terms of (at most) two lines, each moving in a parallel family. If the lines have the same slope they either coincide or don't intersect. Otherwise they have a unique point of intersection.
Note: In general linear algebra gives the right tools to analyze matrix equations, e.g. in this problem we can say the following. If \(M=0\) then the space of solutions is either empty or two-dimensional. If \(M \neq 0\) then either there is a unique solution (precisely when determinant \(\neq 0\) ) or, when determinant is \(0,\) the space of solutions is either empty or one-dimensional. For larger matrices the possibilities are more complicated, but they can be described precisely using the language provided by linear algebra.
