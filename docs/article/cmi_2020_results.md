## Direct Admits


The royal road to CMI goes through the olympiads. Most of the students have qualified either through math or informatics olympiad. Muhendar Raj is the only
exception--he was given a direct admit based on his IChO performance. The candidates who qualify through this route usually have other good
options, so only a fraction of them end up taking admission in CMI. For instance, 6 out of 32 students with direct admits have joined CMI. Roughly
an equal number of them have joined ISI.

#### Math olympiad


The INMO awardees are invited to a month-long training camp, IMOTC in HBCSE. Those who complete the IMOTC are eligible
for a scholarship of Rs 4000 per month from NBHM for the duration of their undergraduate studies. The list of participants for the
INMO is also used for selecting students for EGMO and APMO, apart from IMO. The Indian contingent won 5 medals in IMO '19 held in Bath, UK. Anubhab Ghosal secured a silver medal.
The list of students selected to IMOTC 2020 is [here](https://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/List-of-students-invited-to-IMOTC-2020.pdf) (pdf).

The subjective questions in CMI entrance exam are similar to olympiad problems, so students who reach RMO
have an edge over others in the selection process.

#### Informatics olympiad

The Indian informatics olympiad is organized by IARCS and CMI is in charge of the selection process. Students who qualify via this route
are usually good at competitive programming. A few students from CMI who currently have a high standing in Codeforces are  [Rajat De](https://codeforces.com/profile/rajat1603), [Surya Prakash](https://codeforces.com/profile/evilbuggy) and [Goutham R](https://codeforces.com/profile/xorfire).
Dhruv Saraff has achieved an impressive rating while still in high school and is somebody to look out for.

## Region-wise selections

### Bangalore

Surprisingly, Bangalore has more selections than Chennai this year. We would like to highlight two students from the city who have
put out some interesting educational content on the web.


 - Firstly, we have Vishnu Kadiri who has been active on [Math Stack exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/users/818907/vishnu-kadiri) and has
answered many questions on the forum.

<!--

 - Secondly, there is Rajatadri who has published a math article in the magazine 'At right angles'. He gives a
new proof of the fact that medians of a triangle concur.

-->

 - Then there is Naman Kumar who has a fantastic Youtube channel with many expository videos. We highly recommend that you check out [his channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0-gvTKzYKQcjzKcSPfeIkA).
