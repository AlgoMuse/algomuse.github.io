### Instructions

- You are responsible for keeping time. Email all your solutions by 13:30 Hrs IST.
- Write your answers with a dark pen on white paper.
- Find an email from me with the subject line 'Mock test #1: Number theory and trigonometry'. Send your solutions (images) as replies to this email.
- Make sure that the handwriting is clear and no image is blurred.
- Adjust/Reduce the resolution of the camera so that each image is less than 500 KB in size.
- Total marks: 100 (10x4=40 for Part A + 6x10=60 for Part B)

## Part A: Short-answer type questions

**Submission file:** Write answers to all the ten questions on a single sheet of paper. Email a picture of your answer sheet. Name the file as PartA.jpg or PartA.png.
{: .fs-3 }

**For this part, answers must be written without any explanation.**



<ol>

</p>


<p> <li> Let \(x\)  be a real number such that \( \sec x-\tan x=1/3 \). Evaluate \( \sec x+\tan x \).</li> </p>


<p>
<li>Consider the two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) whose prime factorizations are as follows:

\[ a = 2\cdot 3\cdot 5^2 \cdot 7^3 \cdot 17^5 \cdot 23 \]
\[ b = 2\cdot 3^2\cdot 5 \cdot 7^3 \cdot 11 \cdot 17 \]
</li>

<ol>
<li>Write the prime factorization of the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\). [2 marks]</li>

<p><li> Imagine a rectangular carrom board \(ABCD\) with \(AB=17 \) cm and \(BC=16 \) cm.  Assume the striker to be a point moving with no friction. The angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence. The striker is shot from point \(A\)
at an angle \(\alpha\). It bounces of the edges twice and ends up at corner \(C\) as shown below. What is the value of \(\tan \alpha\)?
</li></p>

## Part B: Subjective questions

**Submission files:** Each question in this part must be answered on a page of its own. Name the files as B1.jpg, B2.jpg, etc. In case you have multiple files
for the same question, say B4, name the corresponding files as B4-1.jpg, B4-2.jpg, etc.

**Clearly explain your entire reasoning.** No credit will be given without reasoning. Partial solutions may get partial credit.

<p>
<b>B1</b>. Suppose \(x\) is an integer. What are the possible values of \( x^{65} \pmod{131} \) and why?
</p>

---

<p>
<b>B2</b>. Consider a coordinate grid made up of horizontal and vertical lines of the form \(x=k\) and \(y=k\), where \(k\in \mathbb{Z}\).
Consider a line segment OA where O is the origin and A is the point \(  (10,4) \). Notice that this line segment passes through the
interior of 12 cells. In the figure below, the shaded cells are the ones through which the line passes.

<p>
Suppose a line segment is drawn from the origin O to the point B at \( (48,54) \). How many cells would would OB pass through?
</p>

<p><b>B3</b>. Suppose \( f(x)=\cos^{-1}(\cos (\pi x)) \). Find the value of \( f(2.6) \).</p>

---


<p>
<b>B4</b>. Find five unique positive integers \( b_{1}, b_{2}, \cdots, b_{5} \geq 2 \) such that:

\[ \Large \frac{125}{76}=b_{1}-\frac{1}{b_{2}-\frac{1}{b_{3}- \frac{1}{b_4 - \frac{1}{b_5} }  }} \]
</p>


<p>
You may find the following fact useful:
</p>

<p>
Let \(q\) and \(n\) be relatively prime positive integers such that \( 1 < q < n \).
There exist unique integers \( k, r \) such that \( n=kq-r, 0 \leq r< q \).
</p>


---


<p>
<b>B5</b>. Find all the positive integer solutions to the following equation:
\[ xyz-xy-yz-xz+x+y+z=52 \]

Express the solutions as triplets \( (x,y,z) \).
</p>

<p>
<b>B6</b>. Prove that there are no integers \(x>0\) and \(n>0\) such that  \( x(x+1) = 2442^n \).
</p>

Please note: There was a typo in the last problem B6 earlier. It's 2442 not 2021.
