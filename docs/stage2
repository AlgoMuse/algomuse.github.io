$\frac{\ln (12)}{\ln (18)}=\log _{18}(12) .$ Suppose this is rational, say $=\frac{a}{b}$ where $a, b$ are integers with $b \neq 0$
Then $18^{\frac{a}{b}}=12,$ so $18^{a}=12^{b} .$ By factoring into primes this gives $3^{2 a} 2^{a}=3^{b} 2^{2 b},$ which by unique factorization can happen only if $2 a=b$ and $a=2 b$. But this gives $a=b=0$, a contradiction. (Alternatively and similarly, prove that $r=\frac{\ln (2)}{\ln (3)}$ is irrational and show that rationality of $\frac{\ln (12)}{\ln (18)}=\frac{\ln 3+2 \ln 2}{2 \ln 3+\ln a}=\frac{1+2 r}{2+r}$ would force $r$ to be rational as well.)
