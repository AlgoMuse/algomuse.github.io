## Style of questions

CMI Tomato mock tests will have questions modeled along the lines of previous years' questions. Emphasis will be slightly more
on standard techniques rather than ingenuity.


## Format
Each test will have 10 objective questions and 6 subjective questions. Each test will carry a total of 100 marks (40+60).


<!--
## Types of tests

There will be two types of tests every month: full-syllabus and topic-specific tests. Tests of the latter kind will have questions confined
to one or two topics. For example, the [first test](/docs/mock_test/001_feb_7_nt_trig) in February had questions only from number theory and trigonometry.
A full-syllabus test will be at par with a CMI entrance exam.

## What happens if you miss a test?

If you miss a test, you can self-administer the test offine and send your responses within a day. For example, if the test was conducted on Sunday, you
should submit your solutions by Monday midnight. Your submission will be considered as an offline entry and will not be included in the official rankings.
But your solutions will be evaluated.

## Subscription options

<img src="/assets/images/subscribe.png"/>

**Please note: Subscription has to be renewed each month.**

The beginner option is recommended for students who are in Std. XI and who are yet to fully cover the syllabus. If you
feel inadequately prepared on a particular month's topics, you can opt out of paid subscription for that month.


Free subscribers can also submit solutions. I will pick two random submissions among them and give full feedback.
