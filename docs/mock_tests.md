## Style of questions

CMI Tomato mock tests will have questions modeled along the lines of previous years' questions. Emphasis will be slightly more
on standard techniques rather than ingenuity.


## Format
Each test will have 10 objective questions and 6 subjective questions. Each test will carry a total of 100 marks (40+60).


<!--
## Schedule

The mock tests for the year 2023 is over. The next round of mock tests will start in Jan 2024.

-->


## Current schedule


Date | Day | Timing | Topics
---|---|--|--
10 Feb '24 | Saturday | 2pm - 5pm | Full-syllabus test
24 Feb '24| Saturday | 2pm - 5pm | Full-syllabus test



## Registration fees

A payment of Rs. 700 must be sent to the UPI address given below.
Please send me an email with the transaction number or a screenshot so that I can link your payment to
your email ID.

**Please note: Subscription has to be renewed each month.**

### UPI Address: cmi-tomato@sbi

## Types of tests

There will be two types of tests every month: full-syllabus and topic-specific tests. Tests of the latter kind will have questions confined
to one or two topics. For example, the [first test](/docs/mock_test/001_feb_7_nt_trig) in February had questions only from number theory and trigonometry.
A full-syllabus test will be at par with a CMI entrance exam.

<br>Please note that the payment must be renewed every month.


## What happens if you miss a test?

If you miss a test, you can self-administer the test offine and send your responses within a day. For example, if the test was conducted on Friday, you
should submit your solutions by Saturday midnight. Your submission will be considered as an offline entry and will not be included in the official rankings.
But your solutions will be evaluated.

## Subscription options

<img src="/assets/images/subscribe.png"/>

**Please note: Subscription has to be renewed each month.**

The beginner option is recommended for students who are in Std. XI and who are yet to fully cover the syllabus. If you
feel inadequately prepared on a particular month's topics, you can opt out of paid subscription for that month.


Free subscribers can also submit solutions. I will pick two random submissions among them and give full feedback.
