# About the author

 I am Mallesh and I spend most of my time writing math though I'm an electrical engineer by training.  I made this website because I felt there was a dearth of resources when it comes to preparing for CMI. If you have an alternate solution to any of the problems, feel free to email me.  If you are a CMI student, please tell me if you find my cut-off guess-timates reasonable.<br><br>
