### Instructions

- You are responsible for keeping time. All your solutions must be emailed by 13:30 Hrs, IST. Solutions submitted after this time will be considered as [offline entries](/docs/mock_tests/#what-happens-if-you-miss-a-test).
- In your Inbox, find the email from me with the subject line 'Mock test #1: Number theory and trigonometry'. Send your solutions as replies to this email.
- Part A's answers must be written on a **single page**. Email a picture of this page. Name this file as PartA.jpg or PartA.png.
- Each question of Part B must be answered on a page of its own. Name the files as B1.jpg, B2.jpg, etc.
- Make sure that the handwriting is clear and no image is blurred.
- Adjust/Reduce the resolution of the camera so that each image is less than 500 KB in size.
- Total marks: 100 (40 for Part A + 60 for Part B)

## Part A: Short-answer type questions

<ol>

<p>
<li>List all the numbers between 1 and 1000 that are both divisible by 7 and have exactly six factors.</li>
</p>

<p>
<li>Consider the two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) whose prime factorizations are given below:

\[ a = 2\cdot 3\cdot 5^2 \cdot 7^3 \cdot 17^5 \cdot 23 \]
\[ b = 2\cdot 3^2\cdot 5 \cdot 7^3 \cdot 11 \cdot 17 \]
</li>

<ol>
<li>Write the prime factorization of the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\). [2 marks]</li>
<li>Write the prime factorization of the LCM of \(a\) and \(b\). [2 marks]</li>
</ol>

</p>


<p><li>How many ordered pair of integers \( (x,y) \) satisfy the equation \( \frac{x}{20} = \frac{20}{y} \)?</li></p>


<p>
<li> Count the number of ordered pairs \( (a,b) \)  that satisfy two conditions:

<ul>
<li>\(a\) and \(b\) are relatively prime positive integers</li>
<li>The product of \(a\) and \(b\) is \(10!\)</li>
</ul>
</li>
