### Instructions

- You are responsible for keeping time. Email all your solutions by 13:30 Hrs IST.
- Write your answers with a dark pen on white paper.
- Find an email from me with the subject line 'Mock test #1: Number theory and trigonometry'. Send your solutions (images) as replies to this email.
- Make sure that the handwriting is clear and no image is blurred.
- Adjust/Reduce the resolution of the camera so that each image is less than 500 KB in size.
- Total marks: 100 (40 for Part A + 60 for Part B)

**Questions will appear below at the scheduled time.**



## Part A: Short-answer type questions

Answers to all the ten questions must be written on a single sheet of paper. Email a picture of this answersheet. Name the file as PartA.jpg or PartA.png.
{: .fs-3 }



## Part B: Subjective questions

Each question in this part must be answered on a page of its own. Name the files as B1.jpg, B2.jpg, etc. In case you have multiple files
for the same question, say B4, name the corresponding files as B4-1.jpg, B4-2.jpg, etc.
