**For this part, answers must be written without any explanation.**

<ol>

<li>We have a supply of ice-creams, each of which has two properties: the flavour can be strawberry or vanilla and the cone can be colored brown or green. Half of the ice-creams have a strawberry flavour and the other half have vanilla flavour. Also, \(\frac{4}{9}\) of the strawberry ice-creams have brown cones and \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the vanilla ice-creams have green cones.
What fraction of the green cones are strawberry flavoured?

<li>
Suppose \(f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) is an odd and differentiable function.
Then for every \(x_{0} \in \mathbb{R}, f^{\prime}\left(-x_{0}\right)\) is equal to:
</li>

<ol>
<li>\(f^{\prime}\left(x_{0}\right)\)</li>
<li>\(-f^{\prime}\left(x_{0}\right)\)</li>
<li>0</li>
<li>-1</li>
<li>None of these.</li>
</ol>

<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
<b>Ans.</b> (a). \(f(x) = -f(-x) \implies f^{\prime}(x) = f^{\prime}(-x)\). <br>
</details>

<li>
Suppose \(p\) be an odd prime. Let \(N\) denote the second smallest multiple of \(p\) that is a perfect cube.
How many positive factors does \(N\) have?<br>


<ol>
<li> 10 </li>
<li> 12 </li>
<li> 16 </li>
<li> 20 </li>
</ol>

</li>

<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
<b>Ans.</b> (c) <br>
Since \(p\) is an odd prime, the second smallest multiple of \(p\) that is a perfect cube is \(2^3Â·p^3 = 8p^3\).
The number of positive factors is therefore (3 + 1)(3 + 1).
</details>


<li>
There are \(n\) cards. Alice and Bob play, alternately, the following game. Alice starts the game by removing
one card. In each subsequent move the current player can remove any quantity of cards,
from \(1\) card to \(t+1\) cards, where \(t\) is the number of cards removed by the opponent in the previous move. The winner is the player who removes the last card.
The possible values of \(n\) for which Alice has the winning strategy are:

<ol>
<li> \( n=0\mod 5\) </li>

<li>
If \(x\) and \(y\) are positive integers that satisfy \(43 x+47 y=2023\), compute the minimum possible value of \(x+y\).
</li>

<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
Ans: 45<br>
Taking modulo 43 , one notices that \(47 \equiv 4(\bmod 43)\) and \(2023 \equiv 2(\bmod 43)\). We rewrite \(43 x+47 y \equiv 4 y \equiv 2(\bmod 43)\). The least \(y\) for which this holds is \(y=22\), and computing, \(23 \cdot 43+22 \cdot 47=2023\). It is impossible to have other positive integer pair solutions because all solutions are given by the form \((x, y)=(23+47 k, 22-43 k)\) for integers \(k\). Therefore, the minimal value is \(23+22=45\).

<p><b>B1.</b> 

There are \(n \ge 3\) positive real numbers \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\). For each \(1 \le i \le n\) we let \(b_i = \frac{a_{i-1} + a_{i+1}}{a_i}\). 
Here we define \(a_0\) to be \(a_n\) and \(a_{n+1}\) to be \(a_1\). 
Assume that for all \(i\) and \(j\) in the range \(1\) to \(n\), 
we have \(a_i \le a_j\) if and only if \(b_i \le b_j\). Prove that \(a_1 = a_2 = \dots = a_n\).
</p>

<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>

<i>Solution 1</i>. Let \(m=\min(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\) and \(M=\max(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\).
Assume for the sake of contradiction that \(M>m\).
Then, there must exist an index \(i\) such that \(a_i=m\) and \(\max(a_{i-1},a_{i+1})>m\), giving \(b_i>2\). 
Similarly, there must exist an index \(j\) such that \(a_j=M\) and \(\min(a_{j-1},a_{j+1}) < M\), giving \(b_j < 2\).
This means \(a_i< a_j\) and \(b_i>2>b_j\), a contradiction. Therefore, we have \(M=m\), so \(a_1=\cdots=a_n\).<br>

<p><b>B2</b>. Suppose \(ABC\) is an equilateral triangle with side length 7 cm. We draw the circumcircle of the triangle as shown below.
Find a point \(D\) on the arc \(BC\) such that the distances \(AD,BD\) and \(CD\) are all integers. Write down 
the values of the three distances for your choice of the point \(D\).

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="/assets/images/integer_distances.png"/>
</p>

<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
On the circumcircle of the triangle ABC, pick the point D, which is 3 cm from B. 

We need to find the lengths of \(AD\) and \(CD\). Let's find the length of \(AD\)
by using the cosine formula for triangle \(ADB\). We know that \(\angle ADB=60^\circ\) by subtended angles. 

\begin{align*}
7^2 &= AD^2 + 3^2 - 2\cdot AD\cdot 3\cdot \cos 60^\circ\\ 
AD^2 -3 AD - 40 &= 0\\ 
(AD -8)(AD+5)& \Rightarrow AD=8
\end{align*}


 
Let's find the length of \(CD\) by applying the cosine formula to the triangle \(CDB\). Notice that 

\begin{align*}
\angle CDB &= 120^\circ \\
CB^2 &= CD^2 + 3^2 - 2\cdot CD\cdot 3\cdot \cos 120^\circ \\
CD^2 + 3CD - 40 &= 0 \\
(CD+8)(CD-5) \Rightarrow CD &= 5 
\end{align*}

<p><b>B3.</b>
Show that there does not exist a function \(f:(0, \infty) \rightarrow(0, \infty)\) such that \(f^{\prime \prime}(x) \leq 0\) for all \(x\) and \(f^{\prime}\left(x_0\right) < 0\) for some \(x_0\).
</p>

<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
Suppose there exists a function \(f:(0, \infty) \rightarrow(0, \infty)\) such that \(f^{\prime \prime}(x) \leq 0\) for all \(x\) and \(f^{\prime}\left(x_0\right)<0\) for some \(x_0\). Thus \(f^{\prime}\) is a decreasing function. Define \(g(x)=f(x)-f\left(x_0\right)-f^{\prime}\left(x_0\right)\left(x-x_0\right)\).
Note that \(g\left(x_0\right)=0\) and \(g^{\prime}(x)=f^{\prime}(x)-f^{\prime}\left(x_0\right)<0\) for all \(x>x_0\). Since \(g\) is a decreasing function on \(\left(x_0, \infty\right)\), we get \(g(x) \leq 0\) for all \(x>x_0\). Now \(f^{\prime}\left(x_0\right)<0\) implies, there exists \(x_1>x_0\) such that \(f\left(x_1\right)<0\).

(a) Find a polynomial in \(\mathcal{P}_2\) having at least two distinct roots.<br>
(b) Find a polynomial in \(\mathcal{P}_3\) having at least two distinct roots.<br>
(c) For any polynomial \(P\) in \(\mathcal{P}_n\), show that the arithmetic mean of all roots of \(P\) is also an integer.<br>

Show that there does not exist a function \(f:(0, \infty) \rightarrow(0, \infty)\) such that \(f^{\prime \prime}(x) \leq 0\) for all \(x\) and \(f^{\prime}\left(x_0\right) < 0\) for some \(x_0\).

<p><b>B5.</b>
There is a \(n\times n\) board in which \( (n-1)^2 \) identical coins are kept as follows. Each cell has a coin, except for the last row and the last column of cells.
The cell in the \(i\)th row and the \(j\)th column is indexed by \( (i,j) \). The initial configuration of the board with \(n=6\) is shown below. The sixth row and the sixth column are empty.

<p style="text-align:center">

We can move a coin placed on cell \( (i,j) \) to the cell \( (i+1,j+1) \) if \( 1 \leq i,j \leq n-1 \) and the cells at \( (i,j+1), (i+1,j) \) and \( (i+1,j+1) \) are
empty. How many configurations of the board can we get by a sequence of valid moves? A sequence can have any number of moves, including zero.
