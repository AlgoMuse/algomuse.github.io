\[ \prod_{i=2}^n (1-\alpha_i) \]

</li>

<li>We have a regular hexagon whose area is 1 sq.unit. A triangle is formed by joining the midpoints of alternate sides as shown below. What is the
area of the triangle?

## Part B: Subjective questions

**Submission files:** Each question in this part must be answered on a page of its own. Name the files as B1.jpg, B2.jpg, etc. In case you have multiple files
for the same question, say B4, name the corresponding files as B4-1.jpg, B4-2.jpg, etc.
{: .fs-3 }


**Clearly explain your entire reasoning.** No credit will be given without reasoning. Partial solutions may get partial credit.

<p>
<b>B1.</b> Let \( p(x)=a_{0}+a_{1} x+a_{2} x^{2}+a_{3} x^{3}\) be a polynomial with integer coefficients
such that \(a_{0}\) and \(a_{3}\) are odd numbers.

<ol>
<li>Suppose \(p\) has a rational root \(\frac{p}{q}\), where \(\text{gcd}(p,q)=1\). Prove that both \(p\) and \(q\) must be odd.</li>
<li>Suppose \(a_0,a_3\) and \(a_0+a_1+a_2+a_3\) are all odd. Prove that \(f\) has no rational roots.</li>
</ol>

<p>
<b>B2. </b> By induction or otherwise, show that:

\[ \binom{n}{2} ! >\; 2^{n^2} \]

for all \(n\geq 6\).

<p>
<b>B3.</b> We are given two positive integers \(a>2\) and \(n\) such that the following \(n+1\) numbers
are all composite numbers:

\[ a,a+1,a+2,\ldots,a+n \]

Prove that there exists an integer \(t>1\) such that the following consecutive numbers are all composite:

\[ a^t,a^t+1,a^t+2,\ldots,a^t+n \]

point \(F\) is the projection of \(D\) on \(AB\).

<p>
<b>B5. </b> Let \(\pi\) denote a permutation of numbers from \(1\) to \(12\). We denote
the number at the \(i\)th position by \(\pi(i)\).
For example, if the permutation is \([1,12,11,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]\), then \(\pi(1) = 1\), \(\pi(2)=12\), \(\pi(3)=11\), etc.

Count the number of permutations \(\pi\) that satisfy the following condition:

\[ \pi(i) < \pi(i+1) \;\;\text{for } i \in \{1,2,4,5,7,8,9,11\} \]

Write your answer as a single number (without any factorials or binomials).

<b>B6. </b> We have a function \(f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\) that is twice differentiable and satisfies the following equation:

\[  \int_{x-y}^{x+y} f(t) dt  = 2yf(x)  \]
