## Part B: Subjective questions

**Submission files:** Each question in this part must be answered on a page of its own. Name the files as B1.jpg, B2.jpg, etc. In case you have multiple files
for the same question, say B4, name the corresponding files as B4-1.jpg, B4-2.jpg, etc.
{: .fs-3 }


**Clearly explain your entire reasoning.** No credit will be given without reasoning. Partial solutions may get partial credit.

<p><b>B1.</b>
A pair of prime numbers that differ by 2 are called <i>twin primes</i>. Examples of twin primes are \( \{3,5\} \), \( \{11,13\} \), etc.<br>

(a) Prove that every twin prime pair other than \( \{3,5\} \) must be of the form \( \{6k-1,6k+1\} \) where \(k\) is a positive integer. [2 marks]<br>
(b) Prove that for any prime number \( p \geq 7\), the numbers \( p-2, p, p+2 \) cannot be in an arithmetic progression of primes. [2 marks]<br>
(c) Find the number of primes \(p\) such that \(p, p+10, p+14\) are all prime numbers. [6 marks]<br>

<p><b>B2.</b> Consider the \(n\)th degree polynomial \( p(x)=n\left(x^n+1\right)-2\left(x^{n-1}+\cdots+x\right) \). If \(n>1\), how
many negative coefficients does \(p(x)^2\) have? Express your answer in terms of \(n\) and explain your reasoning.

<p><b>B3.</b> Let \( f\) be a function defined on natural numbers as follows. \( f(1) = 1 \) and for every \(n>1\), \(f\) is given by:

\[ f(n) = f(n-\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor) + n \]


In the above relation \( \lfloor x \rfloor \) denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\). From the above equation we can derive the first few values of \( f\):


\[
\begin{aligned}
f(1) &= 1\\
f(2) &= f(2-\lfloor \sqrt{2} \rfloor ) + 2 = f(1) + 2 = 3\\
f(3) &= f(3-\lfloor \sqrt{3} \rfloor ) + 3 = f(2) + 3 = 6
\end{aligned}
\]

(a) Find the values of \( f(4) \) and \( f(5) \). [2 marks]<br>
(b) Prove that there exists a positive number \(n_0\) such that \(f(n) \leq 3n\sqrt{n} \) for every \(n > n_0\). [8 marks]<br>

<p><b>B4.</b> Ramesh and Kiran are two friends who practice piano every day at school. Ramesh goes to the piano room every day at a random time
between 1 PM and 8 PM. He practices for three hours. Kiran goes to the piano room every day at a random time between 5 PM and 11 PM and practices for one hour. 
The block of time practice need not be contained in the given time interval for the arrival. For example, Ramesh could arrive at 7 PM and practice till 10 PM. <br>

(i) What is the probability that Ramesh and Kiran meet on a given day? &nbsp; [7 marks]<br>
(ii) What is the probability that Ramesh and Kiran meet on at least two days in a given span of 5 days? &nbsp; [3 marks]<br>
