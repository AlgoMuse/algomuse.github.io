### Instructions

- You are responsible for keeping time. Email all your solutions by 13:30 Hrs IST.
- Write your answers with a dark pen on white paper.
- Find an email from me with the subject line 'Mock test 5: Integral Calculus'. Send your solutions (images) as replies to this email.
- Adjust/Reduce the resolution of the camera so that each image is less than 500 KB in size.
- Total marks: 100 (10x4=40 for Part A + 6x10=60 for Part B)

**For students who miss the live test (members only)**<br>
Self-administer the mock test and email your solutions before 21 Mar, 13:30 Hrs. Your solutions will be evaluated
but marks won't be counted for official use in the future. Solutions submitted after 21 Mar, 13:30 Hrs will not be evaluated.

## Part A: Short-answer type questions

**Submission file:** Write answers to all the ten questions on a single sheet of paper. Email a picture of your answer sheet. Name the file as PartA.jpg.
{: .fs-3 }

**For this part, answers must be written without any explanation.**


<ol>


<li>Suppose \(n\) is a fixed positive integer. If \( \int_{1}^{k} x^{n-1} dx = \frac{1}{n} \), what is the value of \(k\)?</li>


<li> Evaluate \( \displaystyle \int_{0}^{2} \frac{1}{\left( x-\frac{1}{2} \right)^2+\frac{3}{4}} dx \).  </li>


<li> Let \( f(x) \) be a continuous real-valued function on \([0, 1]\) for which

\[ \int_{0}^{1} f(x)dx = 0 \text{ and }\;\;\;  \int_{0}^{1} xf(x) dx = 1 \]

Give an example of such a function.

</li>

<li>
Consider the integral \( \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{ \sin^2 x }{\pi^2 - x^2} dx \). Which of these statements are true?
<br>

## Part B: Subjective questions

**Submission files:** Each question in this part must be answered on a page of its own. Name the files as B1.jpg, B2.jpg, etc. In case you have multiple files
for the same question, say B4, name the corresponding files as B4-1.jpg, B4-2.jpg, etc.

**Clearly explain your entire reasoning.** No credit will be given without reasoning. Partial solutions may get partial credit.


<p> <b>B1.</b> Let \( f:[0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+ \) be a continous function such that \( \int_{0}^{1} f(t) dt = \frac{1}{3} \). Show

</p>



<p> <b>B2.</b> Let \( f(x) \) be a real-valued function defined on the interval \( [1,\infty) \). The following equations hold:

\begin{align*}
f(1) &= 1 \\
f^{\prime}(x) &= \frac{1}{x^2+f(x)^2}
\end{align*}
</p>

<p> Prove that \( \lim_{x\rightarrow \infty} f(x) < 1 + \pi/4 \).  </p>



<p>
<b>B3.</b> Consider the parabola given by \(y = x^2\). The normal is
constructed at a point \(P\) and meets the parabola again in \(Q\).
Determine the coordinate of \(P\) for which the arc length along the parabola
between \(P\) and \(Q\) is minimized.<br>
