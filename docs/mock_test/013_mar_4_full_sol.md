## Part A: Short-answer type questions

<ol>


<li>
<p>

</p>
<p>

(c) \(-4 \leq k \leq 0\).<br>
(d) \(k \geq 0\) or \(k \leq-4\).<br>
</p>
</li>


<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
(d) Equating \(k x=(x-1)^{2}\), we get \(x^{2}-(k+2) x+1=0\). The discriminant is \((k+2)^{2}-4=k(k+4) \geq 0\) for \(k \geq 0\) or \(k \leq-4\).

<li><p>Find the remainder when \(\displaystyle \sum_{r=1}^{50} r! \) is divided by 12.</p></li>

<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
Ans: 9. Terms after \(3!\) are divisible by 12.
</details>


<li>
<p>
Find the number of solutions to the equation \(\sqrt{1-\sin x}=\cos x\) in the interval \([0,5 \pi]\).
</p>
</li>

<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
Squaring both sides we get \(1-\sin x=1-\sin^{2} x\) and thus \(\sin x=0\) or \(\sin x=1\).
In \([0,5 \pi]\), we then have \(x=0, \pi, 2 \pi, 3 \pi, 4 \pi, \pi / 2,5 \pi / 2,7 \pi / 2\). 
We need to reject the values \(\pi, 3 \pi, 5 \pi\) as in these cases LHS=1 and RHS=-1. Hence number of solutions is 6 .
</details>

<li>
<p>
The number of real roots of the equation \(x^6-x+1\) is:
</p>
<p>
(a) Zero.<br>
(b) exactly 1.<br>
(c) exactly 2.<br>
(d) exactly 4.<br>
</p>

</li>


<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
(a) Zero. 
</details>



<li>
<p>
Alice has the five letters: A, B, C, D, E. How many ways can she rearrange the letters into three words? The order of the words matter. For example, "AB C DE" and "C AB DE" are different rearrangements.
</p>
</li>

<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
We can permute the letters is 5! ways. Each permutation can be split is \( {4 \choose 2} \) ways. Hence, the required number of ways is \(120\times 6 = 720\). 
</details>


<li>
<p>
Find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial obtained after expanding and collecting the terms of the product \(\left(5x^{2}-5x+1\right)^{10}\left(x^{4}-2x+1\right)^{20}\).
</p>
</li>


<li>
<p>
Let \(f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) be a continuous function such that \(|f(x)-f(y)| \geq|x-y|\) for all real numbers \(x, y\). Then which
of the options below are true?<br>
(a) \(f\) is one-one<br>
(b) \(f\) is onto<br>
(c) \(f^{-1}\) may not exist<br>
(d) \(f^{-1}\) is continuous<br>
</p>
</li>

<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
(a),(b) and (d). If \(f(x)=f(y)\), then \(|f(x)-f(y)|=0\) so \(f\) is one-one. If \(f(1)>f(0)\) the function is monotonically increasing. If \(f(1)< f(0)\), then the function is monotonically decreasing.

Let \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\) and \(\left\{b_{n}\right\}\) be two sequences of non-zero real numbers. We say that \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\) and \(\left\{b_{n}\right\}\) are <i>mostly equal</i> if \(\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}=1\). Which of the following sequences are mostly equal?<br>

(a) \(a_{n}=n-2\sqrt{n}, b_{n}=n\).<br>
(b) \(a_{n}=n^{2}+\sqrt[3]{n}, b_{n}=n\).<br>
(c) \(a_{n}=n!, b_{n}=n^{n}\).<br>
(d) \(a_{n}=\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^{n}, b_{n}=e\).<br>

<li>
We have two identical cups denoted by M and W. Cup M contains a milk and cup W has equal amount of water in it. One spoon of milk is 
transferred to cup W and then one spoon of the mixture in cup W is transferred to cup M. Then which of the following is true?<br>
(a) The amount of milk in cup W bigger than the amount of water in cup M.<br>
(b) The amount of milk in cup W smaller than the amount of water in cup M.<br>
(c) The amount of milk in cup W is equal to the amount of water in cup M.<br>

<p><b>B1 (a)</b> Find a four digit number which on division by 149 leaves a remainder of 17 and on division by 148 leaves a remainder of 29 .
</p>




<p><b>B1 (b)</b> Find all the primes \(p\)  such that \(2^p+p^2\) is also prime.
</p>



<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>

<p>
(a) Let \(x\) represent the required four digit number. Thus \(x=149 q_{1}+17\) and \(x=148 q_{2}+29\).
Since \(x\) is a four digit number \(7 \leqslant q_{1}, q_{2}<70\).
Subtracting the above equations gives

\begin{align*}
149 q_{1}-148 q_{2}&=12\\
148\left(q_{1}-q_{2}\right)+q_{1}&=12
\end{align*}

Hence, since \(q_{1}-q_{2}\) is an integer its value must be zero, which gives
\(q_{1}=q_{2}=12\), and \(x=149 \times 12+17=1805\).
</p>

<p>
(b) Note if \(p>3\), then \(p \equiv 1\) or \(5 \bmod 6\). Then \(p^{2} \equiv 1 \bmod 3\). As \(p\) is odd, \(2^{p} \equiv 2\) \(\bmod 3\), so \(p^{2}+2^{p}\) is divisible by 3 and thus not prime. Thus we only need to check the cases when \(p=2\) and \(p=3\), and we see that \(p^{2}+2^{p}\) is only prime when \(p=3\left(p^{2}+2^{p}=17\right)\).
</p>

<b>B2.</b>  
Three points \(A, B\) and \(C\) lie inside a circle whose radius is 1 cm. Show that \(B C^{2}+C A^{2}+A B^{2}\) is less than or equal to 9 sq. cm.

<b>B3.</b> We have three colors: red, blue and green. In how many ways can we color the vertices of an octagon such that no two adjacent vertices have
the same color? A valid coloring of the octagon is shown below. Adjacent vertices are connected by a line segment.</p>


<p style="text-align:center">
<br><img src="/assets/images/001_22_b3_octagon_coloring.png"/>
</p>


<p><b>Remark.</b> If we were coloring a triangle instead of an octagon, there would be 6 ways to do it. The first vertex can be colored in 3 ways, the second vertex can
be colored 2 ways and the color of the third vertex would be fixed.</p>



For any $n$-polygon with four or more sides, we consider two cases.
Case 1: Vertex 1 and vertex $n-1$ are different colours. Then this means that vertices 1 to $n-1$ can be coloured in all ways possible for a $n-1$ gon and the colour of vertex $n$ is fixed. Case 2: Vertex 1 and vertex $n-1$ are the same colour. Then vertices 1 to $n-2$ can be coloured in all ways possible for a $n-2$ gon, and then there are 2 ways to colour vertex $n$.
We define $a_{n}$ as the legal colourings of an $n$-gon. Then $a_{n}$ can be recursively defined as
$$
a_{n}=a_{n-1}+2 a_{n-2}
$$
Therefore, for $n=8, a_{n}=258$.
