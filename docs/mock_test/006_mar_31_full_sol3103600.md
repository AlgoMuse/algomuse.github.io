</li>


<li>
Suppose \(a_i\) and \(b_i\) are real numbers such that \(\sum_1^\infty a_i^2\) and \(\sum_1^\infty b_i^2\) converge. Which of these statements is true?

<ol>
<li>The sequence \(\sum_1^\infty |a_i-b_i| \) converges. </li>
<li>The sequence \(\sum_1^\infty |a_i-b_i|^{3/2} \) converges. </li>

</li>


<li>
<p>
Let \(\phi(n)\) denote the number of positive integers less than \(n\) that are relatively prime to \(n\).
In other words, \(\phi(n)\) counts all \(m\) such that
\(\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=1\).


</p>


<p>
The number \(n=220358\) is a product of three primes \(p\), \(q\) and \(r\).
We also know that \(\phi(n) = 109480.\)
</p>

<p>
Find the values of \(p\), \(q\) and \(r\).
</p>

</li>





<details><summary>Solution</summary>

<p>
Given \(n=2\times p q=2\times 110179\). The number of integers relatively prime to \(n\) and smaller than \(n\) is \((p-1)(q-1) .\) So we have \(p q-p-q+1=109480 .\) We get \(p+q=700 .\) Now \(p, q\) are solutions to the quadratic \(x^{2}-700 x+110179\).
</p>

<p>
The discriminant of this quadratic is \(\sqrt{490000-440716}=\sqrt{49284}=222\). So we get \(p=\frac{700+222}{2}=461\) and \(q=\frac{700-222}{2}=239\).
</p>

</details>


<li>
<p>Calculate the determinant of the matrix given below:

\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6\\
2 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6\\
3 & 3 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6\\
4 & 4 & 4 & 4 & 5 & 6\\
5 & 5 & 5 & 5 & 5 & 6\\
6 & 6 & 6 & 6 & 6 & 6\\
\end{bmatrix}
</p>

</li>


<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
Subtract the second column from the first, and then use the first column to eliminate the first row.
Then do it again on the remaining \( 5 \times 5\)  principal minor. The answer is -6.

<p>
4. Let \(\pi\) denote a permutation of numbers from \(1\) to \(12\). We denote
the number at the \(i\)th position by \(\pi(i)\).
For example, if the permutation is \([1,12,11,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]\), then \(\pi(1) = 1\), \(\pi(2)=12\), \(\pi(3)=11\), etc.

Count the number of permutations \(\pi\) that satisfy the following condition:

\[ \pi(i) < \pi(i+1) \;\;\text{for } i \in \{1,2,4,5,7,8,9,11\} \]

Write your answer as a single number (without any factorials or binomials).

5. We have a function \(f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\) that is twice differentiable and satisfies the following equation:

\[  \int_{x-y}^{x+y} f(t) dt  = 2yf(x)  \]

Prove that \(f(x)=ax+b\) for some \(a,b\in\mathbb{R}\).
