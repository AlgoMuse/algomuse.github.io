Find all possible pairs of integers \((m, n)\) which satisfy \(m^{2}+2 m-35=2^{n}\).

<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
Factoring, we have \( (m+7)(m-5)=2^{n}\). We observe that \(m+7\) and \(m-5\) are 12 apart,
and also observe that the only powers of 2 which differ by 12 are 4 and \(16,\) so \(n=2+4=6\).
There are two cases:<br>
(a) \(m+7=16\) and \(m-5=4\), which gives us \(m=9\).<br>

(b) \(m+7=-4\) and \(m-5=-16\), which gives us \(m=-11\).

The answer is therefore (9,6) and (-11,6).

There are \(n\) stones arranged in a circular pattern. At time \(t=0\) s, two grasshoppers are resting on a common stone. Grasshopper A starts to hop
in clockwise direction in intervals of 3 stones. Grasshopper B jumps every 7 stones at each time step in anti-clockwise manner. The figure below
shows the first jump. What is the earliest time step when both the grasshoppers land on the same stone again? Find this number when \(n=300\) and when \(n=301\).

## Part B: Subjective questions

**Submission files:** Each question in this part must be answered on a page of its own. Name the files as B1.jpg, B2.jpg, etc. In case you have multiple files
for the same question, say B4, name the corresponding files as B4-1.jpg, B4-2.jpg, etc.

<b>B1. </b> We have two circles touching each other as shown below. The radius of the smaller circle is \(r\). \(CM\) is the
diameter of the inner circle. \(AB\) is a tangent to the inner circle with \(M\) as its midpoint. Suppose \( |MA|=|MB|=a\) cm. Find the radius of the larger circle in terms of \(a\) and \(r\).

<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>

Let the radius of the larger circle be \(R\).  Now \(CM=2r\)  and \( MD=2(R-r) \). From Ptolemy's theorem, we have:

\begin{align*}
& CM \cdot MD=AM \cdot MB \\
\quad 2 r \cdot 2(R-r) &=a^{2} \\
\quad R &=\frac{a^{2}+4 r^{2}}{4 r}
\end{align*}

<b>B5.</b> We are given a number \(P\). We want to pick \(n\) positive integers \(x_1,\ldots,x_n\) such that two conditions are met:<br>

<i>Condition 1:</i> The product of the \(x_i\)s must be \(P\). That is, \( x_1\times x_2\times\ldots x_n = P\).<br>
<i>Condition 2:</i> The GCD of \(x_1,\ldots,x_n\) is maximized.


<br><br>

(a) Let us denote the GCD by \(g\).  If the prime factorization of \( P=p_{1}^{k_{1}} \ldots p_{\ell}^{k_{\ell}}\), what is the value of \(g\)?<br>

(b) Write the value of \(g\) for \(n=5\) and \(P=2^5 \cdot 3^6\cdot 5^{10} \cdot 7^3\).
</p>




<details open>
<summary>Sol.</summary>


<p>
Let \(g\) be the GCD  of \(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\). Since \(x_{i}\) is a multiple of \(g\), \(P\) must be a multiple of \(g^{n}\).
But if \(P\) is a multiple of \(g^{n}\) we can make the GCD \(g\) by the following assignment:

\[ x_{1}=\cdots=x_{n-1}=g, x_{n}=g \times \frac{P}{g^{n}}\]

Thus, the answer is the maximum \(g\) such that \(g^{n}\) divides \(P\).

Let \( P=p_{1}^{k_{1}} \ldots p_{\ell}^{k_{\ell}}\) be the prime factorization of \(P\).
Then, \(g\) must be of the form \( g=p_{1}{ }^{k_{1}^{\prime}} \ldots p_{\ell}{ }^{k_{\ell}^{\prime}}\)
and \(g^{n}\) divides \(P\) when \(n k_{i}^{\prime} \leq k_{i}\) for each \(i\).
In order to maximize \(g\) we should choose \( k_{i}^{\prime}=\lfloor \frac{k_{i}}{n} \rfloor \).
Thus, the answer is \(p_{1}^{\left\lfloor\frac{k_{1}}{n}\right\rfloor} \ldots p_{\ell}^{\left\lfloor\frac{k_{\ell}}{n}\right\rfloor}\).

<b>B6.</b> We have a square grid where \( (0,0) \) is the origin and \( (6,6) \) is the top-right corner. We want to move from
the origin to \( (6,6) \) using only right steps and upward steps. It is a well known fact that there are \( {}^{12}C_6 \) ways of doing this. Consider the
following addtional constraint: We are not allowed to step on the eight shaded coordinates shown in the figure below. How many ways are there to go from \( (0,0) \) to \( (6,6) \) obeying these constraints?
