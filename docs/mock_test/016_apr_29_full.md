## Part A: Short-answer type questions

**Submission file:** Write answers to all the ten questions on a single sheet of paper. Email a picture of your answer sheet. Name the file as PartA.jpg or PartA.png.
{: .fs-3 }

**For this part, answers must be written without any explanation.**



<ol>

<li>
<p>Let \(I \subseteq R\) be an interval and \(f : I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) be a differentiable function. Let
 \[J =  \Bigg\{ \dfrac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a} : a, b \in I, a< b \Bigg\} \]

Which of the following are true?<br>

(a) \(J\) is an interval.<br>
(b) \(J \subseteq f'(I)\) <br>
(c) \(f'(I) - J\) contains at most two elements.<br>
(d) \(f'(I) - J\) can contain infinite number of elements.
</p>
</li>


<li><p> The number of subsets of the set \(\{1,2, \cdots, 10\}\) containing at least one odd integer is<br>
(a) \(2^{10}\)<br>
(b) \(2^{5}\)<br>
(c) \({ }^{10} C_{5}\) <br>
(d) \(2^{10}-2^{5}\)
</p></li>

<!--
Solution : (d)
Total number of subsets of the set \(\{1,2, \cdots, 10\}\) is \(2^{10}\). The number of subsets of the set \(\{1,2, \cdots, 10\}\) containing only even integers is \(2^{5}\). Thus the required number is \(2^{10}-2^{5}\).
-->

<li><p>
The number of negative solutions of the equation \(e^{x}-\sin x=0\) is<br>
(a) 1 <br>
(b) 2 <br>
(c) 0 <br>
(d) infinite.
</p></li>

<!--
Solution : (d)
Graphs of \(e^{x}\) and \(\sin x\) intersect infinitely many times for negative real numbers.
-->


<li><p> The last two digits of \(17^{400}\) are<br>
(a) 17 <br>
(b) 09 <br>
(c) 01 <br>
(d) 89
</p></li>

<!--
Solution : (c)
By Euler's theorem \(17^{40} \equiv 1(\bmod 100)\). Therefore \(17^{400} \equiv 1(\bmod 100)\).
-->

<li><p>
Let \(a_{1}=1, a_{n+1}=\left(\frac{1+n}{n}\right) a_{n}\) for \(n \geq 1\). Then the sequence \(\left\{a_{n}\right\}\) is<br>
(a) divergent<br>
(b) decreasing<br>
(c) convergent<br>
(d) bounded.
</p></li>

<!--
Answer : (a)
Note that $a_{n}=n$ for every $n$. Hence, $<a_{n}>$ is an unbounded sequence. Hence, divergent.
-->

<li><p>
Let \(f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) be a differentiable function such that
\[ f(x+h)-f(x)=h f^{\prime}\left(x+\frac{1}{2} h\right) \]
for all real \(x\) and \(h\). <br>

Which of the following is/are true?<br>

(a) \(f\) is a polynomial of degree at most 1.<br>
(b) \(f\) is a polynomial of degree at most 2.<br>
(c) \(f\) is a polynomial of degree at most 3.<br>
(d) \(f\) need not be a polynomial.
</p></li>

(b)
-->


<li><p>
Let \(S=\{a, b, c\}, T=\{1,2\}\). If \(m\) denotes the number of one-one functions and \(n\) denotes the number of onto functions from \(S\) to \(T\), then the values of \(m\) and \(n\) respectively are<br>
(a) 6,0<br>
(b) 0,6<br>
(c) 5,6<br>
(d) 0,8<br>
</p></li>

<!--
Solution: (b)
There can not be a one-one function from $S$ to $T$ because the number of elements in $S$ is bigger than the number of elements in $T$. The total number of functions from $S$ to $T$ is $2^{3}$. Since the constant function from $S$ to $T$ is not onto, the number of onto functions is $2^{3}-2=6$.
-->

<li><p>

Let \(f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) and \(g: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) be differentiable functions such that \(f^{\prime}(x)>g^{\prime}(x)\) for every \(x\). Then the graphs \(y=f(x)\) and \(y=g(x)\)<br>
(a) intersect exactly once.<br>
(b) intersect at most once.<br>
(c) do not intersect.<br>
(d) could intersect more than once.<br>

</p></li>

<!--
Solution: (b)
Let $h(x)=f(x)-g(x)$. Then $h^{\prime}(x)=f^{\prime}(x)-g^{\prime}(x)>0$. Therefore $h$ is strictly increasing. If the graph of $h$ intersects $X$-axis, then $f(x)=g(x)$ at exactly one point. It is possible that the graphs of $f$ and $g$ do not intersect. For example, $f(x)=e^{x}, g(x)=0$. Therefore the graphs $y=f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$ intersect at most once.
-->

<li><p>

The equation \(x^{4}+x^{2}-1=0\) has<br>
(a) two positive and two negative roots<br>
(b) one positive, one negative and two non-real roots<br>
(c) all positive roots<br>
(d) no real root<br>
</p></li>

<!--
Solution: $(\mathrm{C}$ )
Put $x^{2}=y$. Then the equation becomes $y^{2}+y-1=0$. Solving this equation, we get $x^{2}=y=\frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}$. When $x^{2}=\frac{-1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$, we get two real values of $x$, one positive and other negative. But no real $x$ exists such that $x^{2}=\frac{-1-\sqrt{5}}{2}$. Hence The equation $x^{4}+x^{2}-1=0$ has one positive, one negative and two non-real roots.
-->

<li><p> The value of \(\lim_{x \rightarrow 1} \frac{\int_{1}^{x} e^{t^{2}} d t}{x^{2}-1}\) is<br>
(a) 0<br>
(b) 1 <br>
(c) \(e\)<br>
(d) \(e/2\)<br>
</p></li>

<!--
Solution: (D)
This limit is in the $\frac{0}{0}$ form. Then by L'Hospital rule, $\lim _{x \rightarrow 1} \frac{\int_{1}^{x} e^{t^{2}} d t}{x^{2}-1}=\lim _{x \rightarrow 1} \frac{\frac{d}{d x} \int_{1}^{x} e^{t^{2}} d t}{2 x}=\lim _{x \rightarrow 1} \frac{e^{x^{2}}}{2 x}=\frac{e}{2}$
