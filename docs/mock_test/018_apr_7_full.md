## Part B: Subjective questions

**Submission files:** Each question in this part must be answered on a page of its own. Name the files as B1.jpg, B2.jpg, etc. In case you have multiple files
for the same question, say B4, name the corresponding files as B4-1.jpg, B4-2.jpg, etc.
{: .fs-3 }


**Clearly explain your entire reasoning.** No credit will be given without reasoning. Partial solutions may get partial credit.


---


<p><b>B1.</b> A frog is intially at the origin of a co-ordinate plane. It wants to reach a destination point by making a sequence of jumps.
The frog can jump from point \( (x_1,y_1) \) to  point
\((x_2,y_2)\) if the points are exactly 5 units apart in distance or, in other words, if they satisfy:

\[ \sqrt{ (x_1-x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2 } = 5 \]

Note the the frog's coordinates before and after the jump are integers. For example, the frog can jump to \( (3,4) \) or \( (-3,4) \) or \( (5,0) \), etc. 
from the origin. Similarly, the frog can reach either the point \( (10,0) \) or \( (7,7) \) in two jumps.<br>

(i) True or False: The frog can reach any given point with integer coordinates in a finite number of jumps. [2 points]<br>

(ii) What is the minimum number of jumps required to reach the point \( (180,180) \) [8 points]?<br>

For both the parts (a) and (b), explain your reasoning.

</p>

<p><b>B2</b>.  Prove that every positive rational number can be written in the form \( a/b \) such that both \(a\)
and \(b\) are products of factorials of primes. For example,
\[
\frac{10}{9} = \frac{2!\cdot 5!}{3!\cdot 3! \cdot 3!}.
\]

Note that the primes appearing in \(a\) or \(b\) need not be distinct. [10 points]

</p>

<p><b>B3.</b> Consider the following two functions defined on the interval \( [0,1] \):

\[ f(x)=\sin \left(\frac{\pi \sin \frac{\pi x}{2}}{2}\right) \]

and

\[ g(x)=\frac{2}{\pi} \arcsin \left(\frac{2}{\pi} \arcsin x\right) \]

(i) Show that the graphs of \( f(x) \) and \(g(x)\) are symmetric about the line \(y=x\). [3 points]<br>

(ii) Let \(0 < a < 1\) be a fixed number. Show that there are at least two values of \(x\) in the interval \( (0,1) \) such that:

\[ \int_0^x(f(t)+g(t)-2 t) = \frac{(a-g(a))(f(a)-a)}{2}  \]


[7 points]
</p>

---

<p><b>B4</b>.  Determine whether the series
\[ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{1+[\sin n\rceil}} \]

is convergent or divergent. Explain your reasoning. 
Here \(\lceil x\rceil\) denotes the least integer greater than or equal to \(x\). [10 points]

</p>

<p><b>B5</b>. Point \(T\) is chosen in the plane of a rhombus \(ABCD\) so that \(\angle ATC + \angle BTD = 180^\circ\), and circumcircles of triangles \(ATC\) and \(BTD\) are tangent to each other. <br>

(i) Suppose \( O_1 \) and \( O_2 \) are the circumcenters of \(\triangle ATC\) and \(\triangle BTD\), respectively. Prove that
quadrilaterals \( ABO_1O_2 \) and \( DCO_2O_1\) are cyclic. [5 points]<br>
(ii) Show that \(T\) is equidistant from diagonals of \(ABCD\). [5 points]<br>
</p>


---

<p><b>B6</b>.   Let \(A_{1}=\{1\}, A_{n+1}=\left\{3 k, 3 k+1: k \in A_{n}\right\}\) for all \(n \geq 1\) and \(A=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_{n}\).<br>
(i) What is the set \(A_3\)? [2 points]<br>
(ii) Can 2017 be written as the sum of two elements of \(A\)? Explain your reasoning. [8 points]<br>
