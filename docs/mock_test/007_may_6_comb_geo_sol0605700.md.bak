<li>
We have 9 identical white beads and 2 identical black beads. How
many distinct bracelets can we make using all the beads? Two bracelets are considered the same
upto flipping and rotation.
</li>
</p>

<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
Let the shortest distance between the two black beads be \(d\). Notice that fixing \(d\)
determines the bracelet.  Since \(d\in\{0,\ldots,4\}\), there
are 5 different bracelets.

<li>
<p>A unit square is inscribed in a circle. A smaller square sits on the
top edge of the larger square. The top corners of the smaller square touch the circle. Find
the length of the smaller square.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="/assets/images/mt7_small_square.png"/>
</p>

</li>

<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
<b>Ans.</b> 1/5. <br>

Let the side length of the smaller square be \(x\). If the center of the circle is the origin, then the
vertical distance between the origin and the top edge of the small square is \(x+1/2\). The distance
from the origin to the top right corner of the small square is \(1/\sqrt{2}\). Hence, we have:

\[ \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^{2}+\left(x+\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2}=\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2} \]

Solving for \(x\) gives \(x=1/5\).

<br>
<br>

<b>Comment</b>. If you assumed that the top side is tangent to the circle, the answer would be
\( \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}-\frac{1}{2} \right) \). This answer was also marked correct.

Count the number of ordered sequences of \(1\)s and \(5\)s that add up to \(13\).<br>
For example, \( (1,1,5,1,5) \) and \( (1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1) \) are valid sequences.
</p>
</li>


<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
There are 3 sets of 1s and 5s that sum to 13.<br>

In a given sequence if there are \(n\) 5s there will be \(13-5n\) 1s.
We have a total of \( (13-5n)+n=13-4n\) numbers so we want to compute:

\[ \sum_{n=0}^{2} \binom{13-4n}{n} = \binom{13}{0} + \binom{9}{1} + \binom{5}{2} = 20  \]

<li>
Find the number of non-zero solutions to the equation: \(z^{2}+2 \bar{z}=0\).
</li>
</p>




<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
<b>Ans.</b> 3. <br>

Suppose \(z=re^{i\theta}\) for some \(r>0\) and \(0\leq \theta < 2\pi\).

\begin{align*}
r^2e^{2i\theta} + 2re^{-i\theta} &= 0 \\
re^{2i\theta} + 2e^{-i\theta} &= 0 \\
re^{3i\theta} &= -2 \\
e^{3i\theta} &= -1 \;\;\; \text{since } |e^{3i\theta}|=1,\;\;  r = 2
\end{align*}

Hence, the equation has three non-zero solutions: \(-2,-2\omega\) and \(-2\omega^2\).

<li>We have a triangle \(ABC\) and \(AD\) bisects the angle \(BAC\). We know the following
measurements: \(AB=10\) cm, \(CD=2 BD\) and the area of the triangle \(ABC\) is 50 sq. cm. Find the value
of the \(\angle BAD\) in degrees.
</li>
</p>


<p style="text-align:center">

</p>




<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>
Since \(A D\) bisects angle \(BAC\), we apply the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_bisector_theorem">angle-bisector theorem</a> to find AC:
\[\frac{A B}{B D}=\frac{AC}{CD} \Longrightarrow AC=\frac{C D}{B D} \cdot A B=20\]
<br>
Let \(E\) be the point on \(A C\) such that \(B E \perp A C .\) Since the area of \(\triangle A B C\) is 50, we have \(\frac{A C \cdot B E}{2}=50 \Longrightarrow B E=5\).<br>

But \(\triangle A B E\) is a right triangle and \(A B=2 B E\), so \(\angle BAE=30^{\circ}\). It follows that \(\angle BAC=30^{\circ}\) so \(\angle B A D=15^{\circ}\).

Let \(t \in \mathbb{N}\). The number of elements in the set \(\left\{\left(\cos \frac{n\pi}{t}+i \sin \frac{n\pi}{t}\right) \mid n \in \mathbb{N}\right\}\)

<b>Ans.</b> (d)

The complex number \(\left(\cos \frac{n\pi}{t}+i \sin \frac{n\pi}{t}\right) \)
is a root of the equation \(x^t=1\), when \(n\) is even.  When \(n\) is odd, it is a root of the equation \(x^t=-1\).<br>

There are \(t\) distinct roots of \(x^t=1\) and \(x^t=-1\) each. Since, none
of the roots are common, the set has \(2t\) numbers.

An ant is initially at a corner of a cube. At each time step, it moves along an edge
to a random adjacent vertex. What is the probability that it returns to the starting
position after four time steps?
</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="/assets/images/mt7_ant.png"/>
</p>


<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>

If movement happens in three directions the ant cannot come back.
If movement happens only in one direction, there are three paths.<br>

If the movement happens in \(xy\)-plane, there are three paths starting with \(x\):

\[ xyx^{-1}y^{-1} \;\;\;\;\; xyy^{-1}x^{-1} \;\;\;\;\; xx^{-1}yy^{-1} \]

Similarly, there are three paths starting with \(y\). Since there
are three planes, we have 18 paths in two directions. Hence, there are totally
21 favorable paths. <br>

Since there are \(3^4=81\) possible paths. The required probability is \(21/81=7/27\).

Let \(C=(y_1^2,y_1) \) and \(D=(y_2^2,y_2) \). Assume, wlog. \( y_1< y_2 \). <br><br>

<i>Observation 1</i>: Since the slope of \(AB\) is 1,
the x-coordinate of \(B\) is same as that of \(C\).
Similarly, \(A\)'s y-coordinate is same as \(D\)s. So, we have:

\[ A=(y_2-4,y_2) \;\;\; B=(y_1^2,y_1^2+4) \]

<i>Observation 2</i>: Since the slope of \(CD\) is 1:
\begin{align*}
\frac{y_2-y_1}{y_2^2-y_1^2} &= 1 \\

\therefore y_1+y_2 &= 1 \;\;\;(Eq. 1)
\end{align*}


<i>Observation 3</i>: On the complex plane, \( \vec{CA} = i\vec{CD}\).

\begin{align*}
(A-C) &= (D-C)i \\
A-(y_1^2+iy_1)  &= i(y_2^2-y_1^2) - (y_2-y_1) \\
A &= (y_1^2-y_2+y_1) + iy_2 \\
\because A_x & = y_2-4 = y_1^2-y_2+y_1 \\
y_1^2+3y_1+2 &= 0 \;\;\; \text{ since } y_2=1-y_1 \\
y_1 &= -2 \text{ or }\; 3
\end{align*}

Since we have assumed that \(y_1< y_2\), we use \(y_1=-2\) to get:

\[ A=(-1,3) \;\;\;B=(4,8)\;\;\;C=(4,-2)\;\;\;D=(9,3) \]

<b>B1.</b> \(ABCD\) is a cyclic quadrilateral with side lengths as follows.  \(AB = 6\) cm,
\(BC = 12\) cm, \(CD = 3\) cm and \(DA = 6\) cm. Find the length of \(EF\)
in the figure shown below.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="/assets/images/mt7_cyclic.png"/>
</p>


<details open><summary>Sol. </summary>

<b>Ans.</b>  \(10\sqrt{2}\). <br>

The key is to observe that \( \Delta BEC \sim \Delta DEA \). Likewise, \(\Delta AFB \sim \Delta CFD \).<br>


<b>Lemma 1.</b> \(\triangle BEC \sim \Delta DEA \) <br>

<p>
<i>Proof: </i> Since \(ABCD\) is a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum to \(\pi\).
Let \(\angle EBC=\theta\). Hence, \( \angle ADC = \pi-\theta\), so \(\angle EDA = \theta \).
</p>

<br>

<b>Lemma 2.</b> \(AE=4\) cm and \(DE=5\) cm.<br>


<p><i>Proof: </i>

Since \(DA:BC=1:2\) the scaling factor between similar triangles \(\Delta BEC\) and \(\Delta DEA\) is 2.


Let \(AE=p\) and \(DE=q\). Then we have:

\begin{align*}
AB&=BE-AE\\
   &=2DE-AE\\
   &=2q-p
\end{align*}

Also, \(CD=2p-q\). So we have:

\begin{align*}
2q-p &= 6 \\
2p-q &= 3
\end{align*}

Solving for \(p\) and \(q\), we get \(p=4\) and \(q=5\). \(\;\;\;\square\)

</p>


Similarly we have \(FC=8\) cm and \(FD=10\) cm. <br>

Let \(\angle B=\theta\). Then \(\angle F D E=\pi-\theta\). Apply the Law of Cosines to \(\triangle E B F\) to get:


\[ E F^{2}=B E^{2}+B F^{2}-2 B E \cdot B F \cdot \cos \theta=10^{2}+20^{2}-2 \cdot 10 \cdot 20 \cos \theta=500-400 \cos \theta \]

and to \( \triangle E D F\) to get

\[ E F^{2}=D E^{2}+D F^{2}-2 \cdot D E \cdot D F \cos (\pi-\theta)=5^{2}+10^{2}-2 \cdot 5 \cdot 10 \cos \theta=125+100 \cos \theta  \]

Solving for \(E F^{2}\), we get \(E F^{2}=200\). So \(EF=10\sqrt{2}\).

<b>B2.</b>
Count the number of ordered pairs of positive integers \( (a, b) \)
such that the complex number \(z=a+bi\)  satisfies \(|z+2|^{2}+|z-2|^{2}<40\).
<br>
</p>

<details open><summary>Sol. </summary>

The inequality reduces to

\begin{align*}
(z+2)(\bar{z}+2)+(z-2)(\bar{z}-2) & < 40 \\
\Rightarrow 4+2 z+2 \bar{z}+z \bar{z}+4-2 z-2 \bar{z}+z \bar{z} & < 40 \\
\Rightarrow 8+2|z|^{2} & < 40 \\
\Rightarrow a^{2}+b^{2} & < 16
\end{align*}


So we need to compute the number of ordered pairs of positive integers
\( (a, b) \) such that \( a^{2}+b^{2}< 16\).

When \(a=1\) or \(2\), \(b\) can be \(1, 2\) or \(3\), and when \(a=3, b\) can be \(1\) or \(2\).  So there are 8 ordered pairs of positive numbers.

<b>B3.</b> Let \([n]\) denote the set of numbers \( \{1,2,\ldots,n\} \). A bijection \(f:[n] \rightarrow [n]\)
is said to be <i>neat</i> if for every \(i \in \{2,3,\ldots,n\}\) we can find
a \(j< i\) such that \( |f(i)-f(j)| = 1 \).<br>

(a) Prove that if \(f\) is neat bijection, then either \(f(n)=1\) or \(f(n)=n\). [4 marks]<br>
(b) Find the number of neat bijections. [6 marks]  <br>

</p>

<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>

(a) Assume, for a contradiction, that \(f(n)=m\) where \(1 < m < n\).

Divide the range into non-empty sets \( A = \{1,\ldots, m-1\} \)
and \(B = \{ m+1,\ldots , n\}\). <br>

Notice that the difference between an element of \(A\) and an element of
\(B\) is at least 2.  Now consider the two cases:<br>


<i> Case 1 </i> \( f(1)\in A \) : Pick the smallest element \(x\) that maps to \(B\). Now all the elements preceding \(x\) map to \(A\). Hence, a contradiction. <br>

<i> Case 2 </i> \( f(1)\in B \) : Pick the smallest element \(x\) that maps to \(A\). Now all the elements preceding \(x\) map to \(B\). Hence, a contradiction.


Hence, we infer that \(f(n)\) must map to either \(1\) or \(n\). <br>


<br>



<p>
(b) We use induction to prove that the number of bijections is \(2^{n-1}\).
For \(n=1\), there is only one function.
</p>

<p>
Here is a way to get all bijections of size \(n+1\) given bijections for size \(n\).

Let \(f_n\) denote a bijection on \([n]\) elements. <br>

<i> Case 1: </i> Given \(f_n\) we make \(f_{n+1}\) by adding a map \(f(n+1) = n+1\). <br>

<i> Case 2: </i> Given \(f_n\) we make \(f_{n+1}\) by adding a map \(f(n+1) = 1\) and then increment \(f(x) \rightarrow f(x) + 1\) for all \(x\in\{1,\ldots,n\}\). <br>

</p>

<p> Every bijection of size \(n+1\) must fall into these two cases. So there
are twice as many bijections for \(n+1\) as there are for \(n\). Hence,
there are \(2^{n-1}\) bijections. <br> </p>

<p><b>B5.</b> Let \( A=(0,0) \) and \( C=(1,0) \). Let \(B\) be a point
on the line \(y=x+1\). Suppose \(B\) is the point of tangency of a circle
with chord \(AC\). In other words, a circle with chord \(AC\) touches the
line \(y=x+1\) at point \(B\).<br>

(a) Find all possible values of point \(B\). [5 marks]<br>

(b) Among the possible values found in (a), for which value is
the angle \(ABC\) maximized? Explain. [5 marks]

</p>

<details open><summary>Sol.</summary>

Suppose the center of the circle is at \( (1/2,k) \) with radius \(r\). Since the circle
passes through the origin we have \(r^2 = (1/2)^2 + k^2\). The equation of the circle is then
given by:

\[ \left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=\frac{1}{4}+k^{2} \]


\[ x^{2}-x+y^{2}-2 k y=0 \]


Solving this with \(y=x+1\) yields

\[ 2 x^{2}+(1-2 k) x+(1-2 k)=0 \]


The quadratic equation must have a repeated root if the circle
is tangent to \(y=x+1\). Which means the discriminant of the quadratic
must be zero. This is true if and only if \(2k=1\) or \(1-2k=8\).

<i>Solution 1:</i> When \(k=\frac{1}{2}\), the point of tangency \(B=(0,1)\). <br>

<i>Solution 2:</i> When \(k=-\frac{7}{2}\), the point of tangency \(B=(-2,-1)\). <br>



<br><br>

(b) The first solution corresponds to a circle with chord \(A C\) touching the line of equation \(y=x+1\) at the point \(B(0,1)\). This circle has diameter \(B C\) and the angle \(A B C\) is equal to \(45^{\circ} .\)





<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="/assets/images/mt7_circle_1.png"/>
</p>

The second solution corresponds to a circle touching the line of equation \(y=x+1\) below the \(x\) -axis at the point \(B(-2,-1) .\)
Now, the line \(y=x+1\) makes an angle of \(45^{\circ}\) with the line \(y=-1\), and this angle exceeds \(\angle A B C .\)

<br> Hence, the first solution \(B=(0,1)\) maximizes the angle \(ABC\).
