<li>Solve for real \(x\):

\[ 4^{x}+9^{x}+36^{x}+\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}-2 x^{2}}=1 \]

</li>


Solution. To start with, note that we must have $\frac{1}{2}-2 x^{2} \geq 0$, and therefore $x^{2} \leq \frac{1}{4}$, i.e., $-\frac{1}{2} \leq x \leq \frac{1}{2}$.
Now if $x \geq 0$, then $a^{x} \geq 1$ for any $a>1$, hence $4^{x}+9^{x}+36^{x}+\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}-2 x^{2}}>1$. So the given equation has no solution with $0 \leq x$.
Next, note that $4^{-1 / 2}+9^{-1 / 2}+36^{-1 / 2}=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{6}=1$, and that $\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}-2 x^{2}}=0$ when $x=-\frac{1}{2}$. This
means that $x=-\frac{1}{2}$ solves the given equation. So $x=-\frac{1}{2}$ is a solution of the equation. Finally, suppose that $-\frac{1}{2}<x<0$. Then $4^{x}+9^{x}+36^{x}>\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{6}$, i.e., $4^{x}+9^{x}+36^{x}>1$, and therefore $4^{x}+9^{x}+36^{x}+\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}-2 x^{2}}>1$. So the given equation has no solution with $-\frac{1}{2}<x<0$.
It follows that the only solution to the given equation is $x=-\frac{1}{2}$.
