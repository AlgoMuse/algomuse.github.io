$\mathrm{P}(\text { Tinku gets at least one chocolate })=1-\mathrm{P}(\text { Tinku gets none })=1-\left(1-\frac{1}{k}\right)^{n},$ because in each of the independent steps the probability of Tinku not getting a chocolate is $1-\frac{1}{k}$

There are $\left(\begin{array}{c}(n-1)+k-1 \\ k-1\end{array}\right)$ distributions in which Tinku gets at least a chocolate: give Tinku a chocolate and then use the given formula to find number of distributions of the remaining $n-1$ chocolates among $k$ students. So the answer is $\left(\begin{array}{c}(n-1)+k-1 \\ k-1\end{array}\right) /\left(\begin{array}{c}n+k-1 \\ k-1\end{array}\right)=\frac{n}{n+k-1} \cdot-\mathrm{OR}-$
The number of distributions in which Tinku gets no chocolate $=$ number of distributions of $n$ chocolates among the remaining $k-1$ students $=\left(\begin{array}{c}n+k-2 \\ k-2\end{array}\right) .$ So the desired probability is $1-\left(\begin{array}{c}n+k-2 \\ k-2\end{array}\right) /\left(\begin{array}{c}n+k-1 \\ k-1\end{array}\right)=\frac{n}{n+k-1}$

A5. a) $n$ identical chocolates are to be distributed among the $k$ students in Tinku's class. Find the probability that Tinku gets at least one chocolate, assuming that the $n$ chocolates are handed out one by one in $n$ independent steps. At each step, one chocolate is given to a randomly chosen student, with each student having equal chance to receive it.

b) Solve the same problem assuming instead that all distributions are equally likely. You are given that the number of such distributions is $\left(\begin{array}{c}n+k-1 \\ k-1\end{array}\right) .$ (Here all chocolates are considered interchangeable but students are considered different.)

8. Consider the quadratic equation $x^{2}+b x+c=0,$ where $b$ and $c$ are chosen randomly from the interval [0,1] with the probability uniformly distributed over all pairs $(b, c) .$ Let $p(b)=$ the probability that the given equation has a real solution for given (fixed) value of
b. Answer the following questions by filling in the blanks.

a) The equation $x^{2}+b x+c=0$ has a real solution if and only if $b^{2}-4 c$ is $\geq 0$
b) The value of $p\left(\frac{1}{2}\right),$ i.e., the probability that $x^{2}+\frac{x}{2}+c=0$ has a real solution is Answer: $\frac{1}{16}$ since a real solution occurs precisely when $b^{2}-4 c=\frac{1}{4}-4 c \geq 0,$ i.e., $0 \leq c \leq \frac{1}{16}$ which is $\frac{1}{16}$ traction of the interval [0,1] over which $c$ ranges.
c) As a function of $b$, is $p(b)$ increasing, decreasing or constant? Answer: increasing, because $b^{2}-4 c \geq 0$ if and only if $0 \leq c \leq \frac{b^{2}}{4},$ so $p(b)=\frac{b^{2}}{4},$ which is increasing for $0 \leq b \leq 1$
d) As $b$ and $c$ both vary, what is the probability that $x^{2}+b x+c=0$ has a real solution?
Answer: This is the fraction of the area of the unit square $[0,1] \times[0,1]$ that is occupied by the region $b^{2}-4 c \geq 0,$ i.e., it is the area under the parabola $c=\frac{b^{2}}{4}$ from $b=0$ to $b=1$ which is $\int_{0}^{1} \frac{b^{2}}{4} d b=\frac{1}{12}$

A5. A regular 100-sided polygon is inscribed in a circle. Suppose three of the 100 vertices are chosen at random, all such combinations being equally likely. Find the probability that the three chosen points form vertices of a right angled triangle.

Answer: Only 128 and 127 are magic numbers. See that $n$ is a magic number if and only if $n$ is a power of a prime. (Otherwise, write $n=a b$ with $a, b$ coprime.)

2015-q1

A positive integer $n$ is called a magic number if it has the following property: if $a$ and $b$ are two positive numbers that are not coprime to $n$ then $a+b$ is also not coprime to $n$ For example, 2 is a magic number, because sum of any two even numbers is also even. Which of the following are magic numbers? Write your answers as a sequence of four letters (Y for Yes and N for No) in correct order.
(i) 129
(ii) 128
(iii) 127
(iv) 100

Solution. (a) The probability that a randomly chosen student is well prepared is $5 / 14$ The probability of a well prepared student answering two randomly chosen questions correctly is $\left(\begin{array}{l}9 \\ 2\end{array}\right) /\left(\begin{array}{l}10 \\ 2\end{array}\right) .$ So the probability that a randomly chosen student is well prepared AND answers two randomly chosen questions correctly is $\frac{5}{14} \times \frac{\left(\frac{9}{20}\right)}{(10)}=\frac{2}{7} .$ A student belongs to exactly one of the three preparedness categories, so the desired probability is obtained by adding $\frac{2}{7}$ with the results of parallel calculations for the other two categories. We get
$P(\text { both answers correct })=$
$$
P(\text { well prepared }) \frac{\left(\begin{array}{l}
9 \\
2
\end{array}\right)}{\left(\begin{array}{c}
10 \\
2
\end{array}\right)}+P(\text { moderately prepared }) \frac{\left(\begin{array}{c}
6 \\
2
\end{array}\right)}{\left(\begin{array}{c}
10 \\
2
\end{array}\right)}+P(\text { weakly prepared }) \frac{\left(\begin{array}{c}
3 \\
2
\end{array}\right)}{\left(\begin{array}{c}
10 \\
2
\end{array}\right)}
$$
which equals
$$
\frac{5}{14} \times \frac{36}{45}+\frac{6}{14} \times \frac{15}{45}+\frac{3}{14} \times \frac{3}{45}=\frac{31}{70}
$$
(b) The probability that a randomly chosen student was well prepared given that he answered both questions correctly is
$P(\text { well prepared both correct })=\frac{P(\text { well prepared and both correct })}{P(\text { both correct })}=\frac{2 / 7}{31 / 70}=\frac{20}{31}$

Out of the 14 students taking a test, 5 are well prepared, 6 are adequately prepared and 3 are poorly prepared. There are 10 questions on the test paper. A well prepared student can answer 9 questions correctly, an adequately prepared student can answer 6 questions correctly and a poorly prepared student can answer only 3 questions correctly.
For each probability below, write your final answer as a rational number in lowest form.
(a) If a randomly chosen student is asked two distinct randomly chosen questions from the test, what is the probability that the student will answer both questions correctly?
Note: The student and the questions are chosen independently of each other. "Random" means that each individual student/each pair of questions is equally likely to be chosen.
(b) Now suppose that a student was chosen at random and asked two randomly chosen questions from the exam, and moreover did answer both questions correctly. Find the probability that the chosen student was well prepared.

You are given an $8 \times 8$ chessboard. If two distinct squares are chosen uniformly at random find the probability that two rooks placed on these squares attack each other. Recall that a rook can move either horizontally or vertically, in a straight line.
