It is given that the complex number \\(i−3\\) is a root of the polynomial \\(3x^4+10x^3+Ax^2+Bx−30\\),
where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are unknown real numbers.  Find the other roots.

#### Solution

### Only one real root

Suppose \\(f(x) = x^3 + x^2 + cx + d\\), where \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) are real numbers. Prove that if \\(c>1/3\\),
then \\(f\\) has exactly one real root.

*Requires calculus*.

#### Solution

Since the function has odd degree as the highest power, it has at least one
real root. To show that the function has exactly one real root
we have to show, that it is monotonic in the whole \\(\mathbb{R}\\).
This can be done by showing that \\(f'(x)\\) is always positive when \\(c>1/3\\).

\\[ f'(x) = 3x^2+2x+c \\]

The discriminant of the above quadratic, \\(2^2-4\cdot3\cdot c\\), is negative when \\(c>1/3\\).
Hence, \\(f'(x)\\) is always positive in \\(\mathbb{R}\\).

### Two variables one equation
{: .d-inline-block}

C1,2011
{: label .label-blue}

Show that there are exactly 16 pairs of integers \\((x,y)\\) such that
\\(11x+8y+17=xy\\).

#### Solution


An equation of the form \\(xy=ax+by+c\\) can be written as:
\\[  (x-a)(y-b) = c+ab  \\]

So the given equation is:

\\[  (x-8)(y-13) = 105  \\]

The number of solutions to the above equation is the number of divisors of 105.
We can factorize 105 as \\( 1\cdot 3\cdot 5\cdot 7\\). Every subset of these four numbers corresponds to a divisor, so there are \\(2^4=16\\) solutions.
