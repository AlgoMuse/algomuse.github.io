Let $x^{3}+a x^{2}+b x+8=0$ be a cubic equation with integer coefficients. Suppose both $r$ and $-r$ are roots of this equation, where $r>0$ is a real number. List all possible pairs of values $(a, b)$ Plugging in $r$ and $-r$ in the equation we get $r^{2}+b=0$ and $a r^{2}+8=0 .$ Let the third root be $s,$ then expanding $(x+r)(x-r)(x+s)$ and comparing it with the given equation tells us that $a b=8$. So the possible values of $a, b$ are $-1,-2,-4,-8,$ i. e., both $a, b$ negative such that $a b=8$
