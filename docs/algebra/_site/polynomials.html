Find all the roots of the polynomial:
\[ x^{4}+x^{3}+2 x^{2}+x+1=0 \]
</p>

<p> We factor the polynomial as follows: \(x^{4}+x^{3}+2 x^{2}+x+1=\left(x^{2}+1\right)\left(x^{2}+x+1\right)\).

The equation \(x^{2}+b x+c=0\) has non-zero real coefficients satisfying \(b^{2}&gt;4 c\). Moreover, exactly one of \(b\) and \(c\) is irrational. Consider the solutions \(p\) and \(q\) of this equation.
</p>

<p>Which of these statements are correct?</p>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>


<p>
(b) Both \( \;p\; \) and \( \;q\; \) must be irrational. <br />


Since the discriminant is positive, both the roots must be real. Since \(c\neq 0\), the roots must be non-zero. We know that \(p+q=-b\) and \(pq=c\).
If one root is rational and the other is irrational, then both \(b\) and \(c\) must be irrational. If both the roots are rational, then both \(b\) and \(c\) must be rational. Hence, both \(p\) and \(q\) must be irrational.

<p>Suppose \(x^{3}+a x^{2}+b x+8=0\) is a cubic equation with integer coefficients.
Both \(r\) and \(-r\) are the roots of the equation, where \(r&gt;0\) is a real number.
List all possible pairs of values \((a, b)\).
</p>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>

<p>
Let the third root be \(s\).
By Vieta's formulas we have<br />

\begin{align}
-r+r+s &amp;= -a \\
-rs + rs -r^2 &amp;= b \\
-r^2s &amp;= -8
\end{align}

which implies that \(b=-r^2\) must be negative and  \(ab=8\).

<p>

(b) We have:

\[f(x)=\frac{1-x^{n+1}}{1-x} \mbox{ for } x\neq 1\]

If \(a\) is a root of \(f\), then \(a^{n+1}=1\).

Since \(f(1)=n\), 1 cannot be a root of \(f\). So \(a\neq 1\). The only other possibility is \(a=-1\) with \(n\) being odd.

<p>
A polynomial \(f(x)\) has integer coefficients such that \( f(0)\) and \( f(1)\) are both odd numbers.
Prove that \( f(x) = 0 \) has no integer solutions.
</p>

<details>
<summary> Solution </summary>

<p>
Suppose \(f(x)=c_{n} x^{n}+c_{n-1} x^{n-1}+\cdots+c_{0}\)

Since \( f(0) \) and \( f(1) \) are odd numbers, \(c_0\) is odd and

\[ \text{Parity of } \sum_{i=1}^n c_i \text{ is even}\]


Suppose \(f(x)\) has an integer root \(r\). Let us see what happens to the parity of \( f(r) \).

For \(n\geq 1\), the parity of \(r^n\) is the same as that of \(r\). So:

\begin{align}
\text{Parity of }f(r) &amp;= \text{Parity of }r \times \text{Parity of} \sum_{i=1}^n c_i  + \text{Parity of }c_0 \\
\text{Parity of }f(r) &amp;= \text{odd}

Since \( f(r) \) is an odd number, \(r\) cannot be a root of the polynomial.

It is given that the complex number \(i−3\) is a root of the polynomial \(p(x) = 3x^4+10x^3+Ax^2+Bx−30\),
where \(A\) and \(B\) are unknown real numbers.  Find the other roots.
</p>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>

<p>
Complex roots come in conjugates, so \(-i-3\) must also be a root. So \( (x-i+3)(x+i+3) = (x^2+6x+10) \) must be a factor of \(p(x)\):

\[ p(x) = (x^2+6x+10)(ax^2+bx+c) \]

By comparing the coefficients, \(a=3,b=-8,\text{and }c=-3\). Hence the polynomial is:

\[ (x^2+6x+10)(3x^2-8x-3) \]
\[ = (x^2+6x+10)(x-3)(3x+1) \]

Hence, the other roots are 3 and -1/3.

Suppose \(f(x) = x^3 + x^2 + cx + d\), where \(c\) and \(d\) are real numbers. Prove that if \(c&gt;1/3\),
then \(f\) has exactly one real root.
</p>

<p><em>Requires calculus too</em>.</p>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>

<p>
Since the function has an odd degree as the highest power, it has at least one
real root. The function has exactly one real root since it is monotonic in \(\mathbb{R}\), as proved below.
</p>


<p>
<b>Lemma.</b> \(f(x)\) is a monotonic function in \( \mathbb{R} \).<br />

<b>Proof.</b> Consider the derivative of \(f\).

\[ f'(x) = 3x^2+2x+c \]


The discriminant of the above quadratic, \(2^2-4\cdot3\cdot c\), is negative when \(c&gt;1/3\). Hence, \(f'(x)\) is always positive in \(\mathbb{R}\).


To see why \(f(x)\) is a strictly increasing function, consider any two points \(a\) and \(b\) in \(\mathbb{R}\) with \(b &gt; a\). By mean value theorem,
there exists an \(\alpha \in (a,b)\) such that:

\begin{align}
f^{\prime}(\alpha) &amp;= \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a} \\
f(b) - f(a) &amp;= f^{\prime}(\alpha) (b-a) &gt; 0 \\\\

<p class="label">A5, 2015</p>

<p>
Consider the polynomial \(p(x)=\left(x+a_{1}\right)\left(x+a_{2}\right) \cdots\left(x+a_{10}\right)\) where \(a_{i}\) is a real number for each \(i=1, \ldots, 10\).
Suppose all the eleven coefficients of \(p(x)\) are positive.

Which of these statements are true?

<ul>
<li>(i) The polynomial \(p(x)\) must have a global minimum. </li>
<li>(ii) Each \(a_{i}\) must be positive.</li>
<li>(iii) All real roots of \(p^{\prime}(x)\) must be negative.</li>
<li>(iv) All roots of \(p^{\prime}(x)\) must be real.</li>
</ul>


</p>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>


<p>
All of them are true.
</p>

<p>
(i) Since the degree is even, \(p(x)\) goes to \(+\infty\) as \(x \rightarrow \pm \infty .\) So \(p(x)\) must have a global minimum somewhere.
</p>


<p>
(ii) The roots of \(p(x)\) are \(-a_{i}\)s. Since the coefficients of \(p(x)\) are positive, no nonnegative number is a root of \(p(x)\).
Thus all the \(a_i\)s are positive.
</p>

<p>
(iii) and (iv)  All 10 roots of \(p(x)\) are real and negative. There is a root of \(p^{\prime}(x)\) between consecutive roots of \(p(x)\) (this is valid even in case of multiple roots). So all 9 roots of \(p^{\prime}(x)\) are real and negative as well. For negativity, one can also note that all coefficients of \(p^{\prime}(x)\) are positive and apply the logic in (ii) to \(p^{\prime}(x)\).

<h3 class="d-inline-block" id="find-a-rational-polynomial-with-a-given-root">Find a rational polynomial with a given root</h3>

<p class="label">B1, 2012</p>

<p>
a) Find a polynomial \(p(x)\) with \(\sqrt{2}+i\) as a root and \(p(x)\) having real coefficients.
</p>

<p>
b) Find a polynomial \(q(x)\) with rational coefficients and having the least degree such that \(\sqrt{2}+i\) is a root.
</p>

<p>
c) Show that any other polynomial \(f(x)\) with rational coefficients and \(p(\sqrt{2}+i)=0\) has \(q(x)\) as a factor.
</p>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>

<p>
(a) Non-real roots of a polynomial with real coefficients occur in conjugate pairs.

\begin{align}
\text{Let }  p(x) &amp;= (x-(\sqrt{2}+i))(x-(\sqrt{2}-i)) \\
&amp;=x^{2}-2 \sqrt{2} x+3
\end{align}

Since all the coefficients are real, the above quadratic is an example.

</p>

<p>
(b) The above polynomial \(p(x)\) has one irrational coefficient. We try squaring it as follows:
</p>

<p>
\begin{align}
(x-(\sqrt{2}+i))(x-(\sqrt{2}-i)) &amp; = 0 \\
x^{2}-2 \sqrt{2} x+3 &amp; = 0 \\
x^{2}+3 &amp; = 2 \sqrt{2} x \\
(x^{2}+3)^2 &amp; = 8x^2
\end{align}
</p>

<p>
So \( q(x) = (x^2+3)^2 - 8x^2 \) is a polynomial with integer coefficients with \(\sqrt{2}+i\) as one of its roots. We
found a polynomial with degree 4. We show that 4 is the least degree for which such a polynomial exists.
</p>


<p>
<b>Lemma.</b> There is no cubic polynomial \(q(x)\) with rational coefficients with \( q(\sqrt{2} + i) = 0 \).
</p>

<p>
<b>Proof.</b> Let \( \sqrt{2}+i \), \(\sqrt{2}-i\) and \(r\) be the roots of such a cubic, if it exists. We have:

\begin{align}
q(x) &amp; = (x^{2}-2 \sqrt{2} x+3)(x-r) \\
&amp; = x^{3}-(2 \sqrt{2}-r)x^2 + 2\sqrt{2}r x - 3r
\end{align}

If \(q\) has only rational coefficients, both \(2\sqrt{2}-r\) and \( 3r \) must be rational (Contradiction). \(\;\;\square\)
</p>

<p>
(c)
Let \(f(x)\) be a polynomial with rational coefficients such that \(f(\sqrt{2}+i)=0\).

Divide \(f(x)\) by \(q(x)\) using long division to get quotient \(a(x)\) and remainder \(b(x),\) both
polynomials with rational coefficients.

\[ f(x)=q(x)a(x)+b(x) \]

Using \(f(\sqrt{2}+i)=0\) and \(q(\sqrt{2}+i)=0\) in the equation gives \(b(\sqrt{2}+i)=0\).
Now if the remainder \(b(x)\) is a nonzero polynomial, then it would have rational coefficients, degree less than 4 and \(\sqrt{2}+i\) as a root.
But we have proved in part (b) that such a polynomial does not exist. Hence, \(b(x)=0\) which implies that \(f(x)\) is a multiple of \(q(x)\).

Suppose \(\displaystyle f(x)=\frac{x^{n}}{n!}+\frac{x^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}+\cdots+x+1\).
</p>

<p>
Show that \(f(x)=0\) has no repeated roots.
</p>

<p><i>Requires calculus</i><br /></p>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>


<p>
Since zero cannot be a root of \(f(x)\), we focus only on the non-zero roots. Let us assume, for a contradiction, that \(f\) has a repeated root \(r\neq 0\).</p>

<p>
<b>Fact.</b> If \(r\) is a repeated root both \(f(r)\) and \(f^{\prime}(r)\) must be zero.
</p>


<p>
On differentiating \(f(x)\), we get:<br />
\[ f^{\prime}(x)=\frac{x^{n-1}}{(n-1) !}+\frac{x^{n-2}}{(n-2) !}+\cdots+x+1 \]
</p>


<p>
\[ f(x)-f^{\prime}(x)=\frac{x^{n}}{n!} \]
</p>

<p>
Therefore, \(r\) cannot be a repeated root since RHS \(\displaystyle = \frac{r^{n}}{n!} \neq 0 \).

<p>
Let \(f(x)\) be a polynomial with integer coefficients \(f(n)\) evaluates to a <i>prime power</i> for every integer \(n\). A prime power is a number of the form \(p^{k}\), where \(p\) is prime and \(k\) a positive integer. Prove that \(f(x)\) is a constant.
</p>

<p>
a) If such a polynomial \(f(x)\) exists, then there is a polynomial \(g(x)\) with integer coefficients such that for each nonnegative integer \(n\),
\(g(n)\) is a perfect power of a fixed prime number.
</p>

<p>
b) Show that \(g(x)\) as in part (a) must be a constant polynomial.
</p>

<p>
c) Show that \(f(x)\) is a constant polynomial.
</p>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>

<p>(a)
Write \(f(x)=a_{n} x^{n}+a_{n-1} x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{1} x+a_{0} .\) Then \(a_{0}=f(0)=p^{k}\) for some prime
\(p\) and integer \(k &gt; 0\). Define \(g(x)=f(p x) .\) Then \(g(x)\) is a polynomial such that for each nonnegative integer \(n, g(n)=f(p n)=\) a perfect power of a prime number. This prime number has to be \(p,\) because by evaluating we see that \(g(n)=f(p n)\) is divisible by \(p\).
</p>


<p>(b)
Let \(g(x)=b_{n} x^{n}+b_{n-1} x^{n-1}+\cdots+b_{1} x+b_{0} .\) Then \(b_{0}=g(0)=p^{k} .\) Consider:

\[ g\left(m p^{k+1}\right)=(b_{n}\left(m p^{k+1}\right)^{n}+b_{n-1}\left(m p^{k+1}\right)^{n-1}+\cdots+b_{1}\left(m p^{k+1}\right)+p^{k}\]

Clearly for each non-negative integer \(m\), this expression is divisible by \(p^{k},\) but not by \(p^{k+1}\) (since it is \(p^{k}\) modulo \(p^{k+1}\) ). This forces \(g\left(m p^{k+1}\right)=p^{k}\) for all \(m,\) since it must be a perfect power of \(p .\) Thus the polynomial \(g\) takes the value \(p^{k}\) infinitely often, so it must be identically equal to \(p^{k}\). (Otherwise the polynomial \(g(x)-p^{k}\) would have infinitely many roots.) To finish the problem, note that since \(g(x)=f(p x)\) is constant, \(f(x)\) must be constant by the same logic.

A polynomial \(f(x)\) with real coefficients is said to be a sum of squares (SoS) if we can write \(f(x)=p_{1}(x)^{2}+\cdots+p_{k}(x)^{2},\) where \(p_{1}(x), \ldots, p_{k}(x)\) are polynomials with real coefficients. <br />

Which statements given below are true?

<p>
a) If a polynomial \(f(x)\) is a SoS, then the coefficient of every odd power of \(x\) in \(f(x)\) must be 0.
</p>

<p>
b) If \(f(x)=x^{2}+p x+q\) has a non-real root, then \(f(x)\) is a sum of squares.
</p>

<p>
c) If \(f(x)=x^{3}+p x^{2}+q x+r\) has a non-real root, then \(f(x)\) is a sum of squares.

So the polynomial \(f(x)-x^{2013}\) has all elements of \(A\) as its roots.
Since there are infinitely many values in \(A\) (e.g. applying the intermediate value theorem because \(f\) is continuous), the polynomial \(f(x)-x^{2013}\) has infinitely many roots and thus must be the zero polynomial, i.e., \(f(x)=x^{2013}\) for all real number \(x\).

p_{0}(x)&amp;:=\left(x^{2}+1\right)\left(x^{2}+2\right) \cdots\left(x^{2}+1009\right) \\
p_{k+1}(x)&amp;:=p_{k}(x+1)-p_{k}(x)

with subsequent polynomials defined by  for \(k \geq 0 .\) Find the least number \(n\) for which \[ p_{n}(1)=p_{n}(2)=\cdots=p_{n}(5000) \]

\(n=2018\). Note that \(\operatorname{deg} p_{0}(x)=2018\) and \(\operatorname{deg} p_{k}(x)=2018-k\).
Define \(g_{n}(x)=p_{n}(x)-p_{n}(1)\), hence \(g_{n}(x)\) has degree \(2018-n\) and 5000 roots.

(i) Let \(f(x)=a_{n} x^{n}+\cdots+a_{1} x+a_{0}\) be a polynomial with real non-zero coefficients. What is the leading term of the polynomial \( \Delta f(x):=f(x)-f(x-1) \)?
</p>

<p>
(ii) Define polynomials \(p_{n}\) of degree \(n\) as follows:

<br />

\begin{align}
p_{0}(x) &amp; =1 \\
p_{1}(x) &amp;=x \\
p_{2}(x) &amp;=\frac{x(x-1)}{2} \\
p_{3}(x) &amp;=\frac{x(x-1)(x-2)}{3!} \cdots \\
&amp;\vdots \\
p_{n}(x)&amp;=\frac{1}{n!} x(x-1)(x-2) \cdots(x-n+1) \\
\end{align}



<br />
Show that for any polynomial \(f\) of degree \(n,\) there exist unique real numbers \(b_{0}, b_{1}, \ldots, b_{n}\) such that \(f(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{n} b_{i} p_{i}(x)\)
</p>

<p>
(iii) A polynomial \(f(x)\) is called  <em>integer-valued</em> if \(f(n)\) is an integer for every integer \(n\). Show that if an integer-valued polynomial is
expressed in terms of \(p_n\)s as above, the coefficients \(b_{i}\)s obtained in part (ii) are integers.
</p>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>

<p>
(i) After expanding the powers of \((x-1),\) the degree \(n\) terms of \(f(x)\) and \(f(x-1)\) cancel out.  The degree \(n-1\) term from \(f(x)\)
cancels with the leading term of \(a_{n-1}(x-1)^{n-1}\). The only remaining term of degree \(n-1\) has to come from \(a_{n}(x-1)^{n}\).
So \(\Delta f(x)=n a_{n} x^{n-1}+\mathrm{lower\; degree\; terms}\). This is similar to the derivative. <br /><br />
</p>


<p>
(ii)  We use induction on the degree of \(f .\) If \(f(x)=a_{0}\) is constant, \(b_{0}=a_{0}\) works uniquely (base case).
<br />
<i> Inductive hypothesis. </i> Assume the result for polynomials of degree strictly less than \(n\) and let \(f\) be of degree \(n,\) so \(a_{n} \neq 0 .\) We are forced to take \(b_{n}=n ! a_{n}\) by comparing leading coefficients of \(f(x)\) and \(\sum_{i=0}^{n} b_{i} p_{i}(x) .\)
<br />
Now \(f(x)-b_{n} p_{n}(x)\) is a polynomial of degree \(d &lt; n\) and hence by induction equals \(\sum_{i=0}^{d} b_{i} p_{i}(x)\) for unique \(b_{0}, \ldots, b_{d}\) Therefore \(f(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{n} b_{i} p_{i}(x),\) where \(b_{d+1}, \ldots, b_{n-1}\) are all \(0 .\) To see uniqueness of \(b_{i}^{\prime} s,\) let \(\sum_{i=0}^{n} b_{i} p_{i}(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{n} c_{i} p_{i}(x) .\) Subtract all terms with \(b_{i}=c_{i} .\) If any terms are remaining, compare the leading coefficients on each side to get a contradiction.

<p>
<i><b>Alternate solution</b>. If we are allowed to use <a href="/docs/algebra/solvability/#solutions-to-simultaneous-equations">linear algebra</a>, it is a one-line proof.</i>
The \( p_i \)s form a basis for polynomial functions, so any polynomial has a unique representation.
</p>

<p>
(iii) Substitute \(x=0,1,2, \ldots\) one by one in the equation \(f(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{n} b_{i} p_{i}(x)\) and solve for \(b_{0}, b_{1}, b_{2}, \ldots\) successively. \(x=0\) gives \(b_{0}=f(0) .\) Using \(x=1\) and 2 gives \(b_{1}=f(1)-b_{0}\) \(b_{2}=f(2)-b_{0}-2 b_{1} .\) In general, for all integers \(t, p_{i}(t)=\left(\begin{array}{c}t \\ i\end{array}\right)\) is an integer. Further, \(p_{i}(t)=0\) if \(0 \leq t &lt; i\) and 1 if \(t=i .\) So \(b_{t}=f(t)-\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} b_{i}\left(\begin{array}{c}t \\ i\end{array}\right),\) which is an integer by induction.

(i) What is the remainder when \(f(x)=7 x^{32}+5 x^{22}+3 x^{12}+x^{2}\) is divided by \((x^{2}+1)\)?  <br /><br />
(ii) What is the remainder when \(x f(x)\) is divided by \((x^{2}+1)\)?
</p>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>

<p>
(i) The function has only even powers. Let us put \(z=x^{2}\). We want to know the
remainder of \(7z^{16}+5z^{11}+3z^{6}+z\) when divided by \((z+1)\). By remainder theorem,

\[ 7(-1)^{16}+5(-1)^{11}+3(-1)^{6}+(-1)=4 \]

</p>

<p>
So we have \(f(x)=q(x)\left(x^{2}+1\right)+4\), where \(q(x)\) is some polynomial.

<br />
<br />
(ii) \(x f(x)=x q(x)\left(x^{2}+1\right)+4x\), so the second remainder is \(4x\).

<li>(ii) \(g\) cannot be a polynomial of degree 10.</li>

<p>
True-True-False-False<br />

<p>
(i) If \(g(x)\) is linear, it is uniquely determined by any two values.<br />
</p>

<p>
(ii) If \(g(x)\) is a polynomial then it is of the form \(q(x)(x-1)(x-2) \cdots(x-15) + 3x+5\), where \(q(x)\) is some polynomial.
So \(g(x)\) cannot be a polynomial of degree 10.

<i>The official solution states this fact without a proof. Why should the polynomial have a \(3x+5\) term? It is not clear.  Where is the consecutive property of integers getting used? </i>

<h3 class="d-inline-block" id="given-the-remainders-find-the-polynomials">Given the remainders, find the polynomials</h3>

<p class="label">B5, 2016</p>

<p>Find a single polynomial \(p(x)\) that has these two properties:<br />

(i) If \(p(x)\) is divided by \(x^{100}\), the remainder is the constant polynomial 1.<br />

(ii) If \(p(x)\) is divided by \((x-2)^{3}\), the remainder is the constant polynomial 2.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Requires calculus.</i></p>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>

<p>
\begin{align}
p(x) &amp;= q(x)x^{100} + 1 \text{ for some }q(x)\\
p^\prime(x) &amp;= 100q(x)x^{99} + q^\prime(x) x^{100} \\
\end{align}

</p>


<p>
In the given problem \(p^{\prime}(x)\) is divisible by \(x^{99}\) as well as by \((x-2)^{2} .\) Moreover any polynomial whose derivative is divisible by \(x^{99}(x-2)^{2}\) will leave constant remainders when divided by either of \(x^{100}\) and \((x-2)^{3}\). The simplest way to find one such \(p(x)\) is to integrate \(A x^{99}(x-2)^{2}=A\left(x^{101}-4 x^{100}+4 x^{99}\right)\) to get

\[ p(x)=A\left(\frac{x^{102}}{102}-\frac{4 x^{101}}{101}+\frac{4 x^{100}}{100}\right)+B \]


Let us calculate \(A\) and \(B\).

\begin{align}
p(0)&amp;=B=1 \\
p(2)&amp;=A\left(\frac{2^{102}}{102}-\frac{4 \times 2^{101}}{101}+\frac{4 \times 2^{100}}{100}\right)+1=2
\end{align}

So \(A=2\) and \(B=1\).
