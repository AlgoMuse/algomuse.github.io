When universities in the United States are looking to recruit mathematics students
from India, one of the first places they look for applications is from CMI, if not the first place. Universities that are able to get CMI students are always very proud.

## CMI entrance exam cutoffs

The cutoff has been around 35% for the objective section and 40-50% overall. The objective section is used for screening.<br>

CMI does not publish the cutoff marks on their website but they have responded to individual requests in the past. The below-given scores are estimates based on inputs from former students.
